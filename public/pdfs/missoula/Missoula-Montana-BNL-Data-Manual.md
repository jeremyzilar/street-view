By-Name List Operations Manual  
Introduction  
A By-Name List (BNL) allows a coordinated entry system to know everyone in our community  experiencing 
houselessness in real time.  
Without this information, we cannot: 
- 
Understand the scope of houselessness in our community 
- 
Understand how people move in and out of our system on an ongoing basis 
- 
Have accurate information to set goals to reduce houselessness 
- 
Have accurate information to understand if we are making progress in ending houselessness 
The key components of a quality By-Name List include ensuring that our system is touching everyone who is unhoused 
in our community; that we can accurately assess who is entering our unhoused system on an ongoing basis; and that 
we can accurately track progress through the system, including how successful we are in implementing prioritization 
and providing permanent housing to those who need it. 
This is a living document that will change over time, please ensure you have the most recent copy (found on MCES 
Drive). 
Amendments, Approval, + Feedback 
The By-Name List Operations Manual is reviewed by the Missoula Coordinated Entry System (MCES)’s Oversight 
Committee. The primary responsibilities of the MCES  Oversight Committee are to 
- 
Develop the policies and procedures that ensure the coordinated entry process operates per the standards 
as designed by the community around the system's core elements: Access, Assessment, Prioritization, and 
Referral  
- 
Review system data and metrics to identify gaps and barriers and recommend adjustments accordingly 
- 
Monitoring operations and reviewing and recommending policy additions and changes 
- 
Oversee all policies relative to coordinated entry operations, via group decisions, guiding principles, and 
core elements 
- 
All suggested changes will be presented and voted on at the Oversight Committee with a 50% +1  vote 
- 
Procedures will be reevaluated annually in February 
To offer feedback to the MCES Oversight Committee, please contact meeting chairs, Sam Hilliard at 
hilliards@ci.missoula.mt.us and/or Lena Negrete at lln@hrcxi.org.

BNL Deﬁnitions 
A BNL is intended to include everyone in a community experiencing houselessness, meaning that the list will most 
likely have a larger universe of people than who is included in HMIS. Instances may exist in which counts from 
adjacent systems (criminal justice, education, etc.) may need to be accounted for outside of HMIS. “BNL Deﬁnitions” 
describes data origin, program eligibility, and commonly used terms.  
Populating the BNL 
MCES’s BNL is populated via the Homeless Management Information System (HMIS) and the YWCA’s Domestic 
Violence  Unique ID list (managed externally to HMIS, for safety). 
Who is included on the BNL 
To be added to the MCES BNL (without redacted information), an individual or family must have both an MCES Program 
Enrollment and MT CoC Release of Information signed.  If a household does not have a MT CoC Release completed, 
they can still be enrolled in MCES, but Personally Identiﬁable Information (PII)  will be removed from shared 
documents. Getting a completed ROI should be a priority. 
Currently, MCES can serve those in HUD categories 1 and 4. 
- 
Category 1, Literally Homeless: Individual or family lacks a ﬁxed, regular, and adequate nighttime residence, 
meaning:  
- 
Primary nighttime residence that is a public or private space not meant for human habitation 
- 
Is living in a publicly or privately operated shelter designated to provide temporary living 
arrangements (includes congregate shelters, transitional housing, and hotels/motels paid for by a 
nonproﬁt or governmental program) 
- 
Is exiting an institution where they have resided for 90 days or less and who was literal homeless 
prior to entering that institution 
 
- 
Category 4, Fleeing or Attempting to Flee Domestic Violence: An individual or family who:  
- 
Is ﬂeeing, or attempting to ﬂee, domestic violence;  
- 
Has no other residence; and 
- 
Lacks the resources or support networks to obtain other permanent housing 
 
- 
Currently MCES is NOT serving those in HUD categories 2 and 3 
- 
Category 2, Imminent Risk of Homelessness: An individual or family who will imminently lose their 
primary nighttime residence, provided that: 
● Residence will be lost within 14 days of the date of application for homeless 
assistance 
● No subsequent residence has been identiﬁed; and 
● The individual or family lacks the resources or support networks needed to obtain 
other permanent housing. 


 
● Note: Includes individuals and families who are within 14 days of losing their 
housing, including housing they own, rent, are sharing with others, or are living in 
without paying rent. 
- 
Category 3: Homeless Under Other Federal Statutes: Unaccompanied youth under 25 years of age, 
or families with Category 3 children and youth, who do not otherwise qualify as homeless under this 
deﬁnition, but who: 
● Are deﬁned as homeless under the other listed federal statutes; 
● Have not had a lease, ownership interest in permanent housing during the 60 
days prior to the homeless assistance application; 
● Have experienced persistent instability as measured by two moves or more 
during in the preceding 60 days; and 
● Can be expected to continue in such status for an extended period of time due to 
special needs or barriers 
BNL Common Terms + Explanations 
Household Types 
Family: A household with children or dependent(s) under the age of 
18 OR an individual who identiﬁes as pregnant 
Youth (Unhoused Young People): Individuals or heads of household 
who are aged 18-24 years 
Veterans: Individuals who self-identify as veterans 
Singles: Those that do not qualify under other populations of interest. 
(over the age of 24 who are not families) 
Exits (no longer active in the system) 
A household is considered exited from the MCES program when they:  
Find temporary (as deﬁned by the MCES Oversight Committee) or 
permanent housing 
Move outside of Missoula/Ravalli/Mineral Counties 
Enter an institution for 90 days or longer 
*If <90 days, will remain active 
Pass away 


 
Inactive 
Have not had a service transaction for 90+ days 
Reviewed on a monthly basis by Case Conferencing participants via 
the Outﬂow Process. 
For a full list of Inactive Destinations, see Exit Destinations. Inactive 
destinations include all exits that are not permanent - Temporary or 
Institutional settings, Death, or Sober Living.  
Outﬂow Process 
A list of participants reaching 90 days without a service transaction is 
shared with partners/access points to review every month.  
Initial review: for the ﬁrst two weeks of the month, partnering staff 
review the list, adding service transactions for those they know are 
still unhoused/MCES eligible. 
Final Review: In the second two weeks of the month,  a fresh pull of 
the Outﬂow occurs, alerting the system to which households need 
targeted outreach. The remaining households with contact 
information are divided amongst providers who provide one ﬁnal  
call/email to check in - Are they housed? Out of the area? Still 
unhoused and would like to remain active?  See Final Review Outﬂow 
Guide.  
All outreach attempts are to be recorded in HMIS under each 
household’s Client Notes. 
Any households that do not have a service transaction added after the 
ﬁnal Outﬂow review and outreach  are auto-exited to the following 
destinations, as determined by statewide CES. 
Reason for Leaving: Unknown/Disappeared 
Destination: No Exit Interview Completed  
If they return, they will be re-enrolled in the MCES Program in HMIS, 
which triggers their reappearance on the BNL 
*If unhoused the whole time and auto-exited, providers will create a 
new entry on existing client accounts with a backdate to the date of 
their auto-exit. For more information, see Inactivity Policy. 
Chronic Homelessness 
Literally homeless individuals or households with a disabling 
condition who have been continuously unhoused for a year or more 


 
OR have had at least four episodes of homelessness in the past three 
years.  
Currently, this information is populated on the BNL via a self-reported 
data point in the MCES Pre-Screener; chronicity is not veriﬁed until a 
speciﬁc resource requires it 
Returns 
Re-entry into the MCES program under existing client ID upon 
returning to houselessness from an inactive or housed destination. 
Service Transaction 
A service transaction is an action in HMIS that populates “Date of Last 
Contact” on the MCES By-Name List.  
Service transactions for actively unhoused participants should occur 
no less than once per month. 
When to add a service transaction:  
- 
Any time a  service has been provided. 
- 
Examples: gear distributed to a household living 
unsheltered, housing navigation or care 
coordination provided, any interaction occurs that 
tells a provider an individual or family is still 
unhoused in our area 
- 
Shelter stays at the Poverello Center (single adult 
emergency shelter)  are also tracked as service 
transactions 
- 
Aside from shelter stays, all service transactions 
should also include a corresponding Client Note to 
describe service provided (can be brief) 
See Making a Service Transaction step-by-step guide. 
By-Name List Categories 
See Appendix A 
Test Clients 
 
Missoula’s current HMIS platform does not allow for training proﬁle 
creation for new users. As such, those completing initial MCES-HMIS  
training create actual proﬁles within the system.  
- 
Test proﬁles have the last name “Test” 


 
- 
Every 6 months, test proﬁles are wholly deleted from the 
system at the CE Lead’s request to Pathways MISI 
(support@pathwaysmisi.org)  
- 
When test proﬁles are still active, they must be ﬁltered out of 
the BNL 
- 
Organize by last name 
- 
Remove test proﬁles from list 
- 
Final search for “test” to ensure all have been 
removed

BNL Data Security 
The BNL is a ﬂexible tool that assists service providers in helping clients in their housing journeys through Missoula’s 
Coordinated Entry System. The information stored in this list is critical in forming housing solutions but is also 
composed of personal and sensitive information that needs to be protected. In speciﬁc circumstances, data may be 
shared with groups or publicly, with restrictions to protect privacy and conﬁdentiality. 
Access to BNL  
The MCES Lead has access to BNL and Unique Identiﬁer lists. Portions of the BNL may be requested by MCES Partners 
on a case-by-case basis. 
Pathways MISI and WellSky are the only providers that have the ability to build custom advanced reports in HMIS. 
Data Security 
The MCES BNL is stored within Missoula’s current HMIS provider, Service Point (by Pathways MISI), and as a 
password-protected Excel Spreadsheet located with the City of Missoula. 
Data Security is monitored and managed by the MCES Lead and leaders within the system. 
Procedures in place to ensure personally identifying information (PII) is secure:  
- 
All extracted BNLs must be password-protected and are only shared with partnering organizations 
- 
PII is redacted from all shared documents if a  Release of Information is invalid 


 
- 
All partnering and access point agencies have signed MCES MOU, within which are speciﬁc expectations on 
conﬁdentiality 
Domestic Violence Providers 
- 
The YWCA of Missoula’s DV UI List is sent to the MCES Lead as it is updated (~ 2 weeks) 
- 
Mirrors BNL for easy copy/paste 
- 
The YWCA utilizes coding for names; YWCA is the only agency that knows the identities of those 
households 
Unsheltered without Release 
- 
For those unsheltered residents who are not in MCES/HMIS,  the Community Outreach Team manages a  “nonMCES'' 
spreadsheet. This tracking tool allows the Missoula Coordinated Entry System to understand all those experiencing 
houselessness, even if they have chosen not to consent to services or the MAP assessment, or haven’t yet had the 
opportunity. Only the most basic information will be tracked under an alias or street name to preserve anonymity.

information sharing, it is welcomed! First, it  must be approved by the CE Lead with the City of Missoula to 
ensure accuracy. 


 
 
BNL Roles + Responsibilities 
MCES involves staff from many organizations working to functionally end houselessness. Cross-organizational 
collaboration is vital to progress on this goal. The BNL roles and responsibilities are broken down below. 
BNL Activities 
The BNL is pulled twice monthly, on the 2nd and 4th weeks of the month, by the Housing Programs Coordinator or 
Coordinated Entry Lead. 
All staff entering into MCES contribute data to the BNL. 
Data from participant interactions are expected to be entered into HMIS within 48 hours by all partnering agencies 
with HMIS access 
➔ For those without HMIS access, a paper tool may be utilized to gather information. The paper tool must then 
be entered by staff with HMIS access within 48 hours.  
Service transactions must be added for active participants at least once monthly.  
The Unique ID (DV) BNL is sent to the CE Lead any time there has been an update (~ every two weeks).  
Programs Adding Data to BNL 
1. Emergency Shelters

- 
Data quality going into MCES from organization 
- 
For organizations entering large amounts of MCES data, the CE Lead will provide monthly insights on data 
directly to organizational leads. These meetings include information on data quality issues and celebrations 
related to assessments, enrollments, and outcomes (in progress). Additionally, these spaces allow dialogue 
around MCES processes that aren’t available or accessible because of organizational constraints.  
- 
CE Lead currently meets every month with 
- 
The Poverello Center 
- 
Hope Rescue Mission 
- 
YWCA 
- 
Partnership Health Center 
- 
Unhoused Young People 
- 
Chafee 
- 
MCPS 
Quarterly Data Quality Reports for MCES 
(New process) Each quarter, January, April, July, October, the CE Lead will pull a report in HMIS to identify missing data 
within MCES proﬁles.  
- 
 Initially, MCES will focus on  Universal Data Elements and MAP Assessments as the most important data 
points to monitor.  
- 
These data quality reports will be sent out to identiﬁed leads at each access point organization, and any 
other partner regularly entering data in MCES’s HMIS project.   
- 
As capacity for data management expands, additional data quality points should be added (Current Living 
Situation, Chronicity,  and Service Transactions as future priorities).   


 
Document Retention 
The Montana CoC does not have a Coordinated Entry paper document retention period. When paper documents 
cannot be immediately uploaded to HMIS, it is the organization holding the paper tools to apply standard 
organizational retention rates, which will be audited by Pathways MISI on annual visits.
