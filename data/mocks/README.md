### Bed Type Assignment Logic

Bed types are assigned as **names** (not IDs) in Airtable's CSV import format:

**CSV Format**: `"Medical Respite – Women,General Adult Beds"` (comma-separated within quotes)
**JSON Format**: `["Medical Respite – Women", "General Adult Beds"]` (array of strings)

Logic based on demographics:

- **Gender + Medical**: 
  - Men needing medical care → "Medical Respite – Men"
  - Women needing medical care → "Medical Respite – Women"
- **Gender-Specific**:
  - Men → "Adult Men – Dormitory" or General beds
  - Women → "Women's Beds" or General beds
- **Age**: Older adults (60+) → Medical Respite (gender-appropriate)
- **Family Status**: 10% assigned to Family Suites (High/Low Barrier) or Family Rooms
- **Domestic Violence**: 5% assigned to "DV Shelter Beds (Shared Bedrooms)"
- **Flexibility**: 40% also accept Overflow beds ("Congregate Overflow" or "Non-Congregate Units")

### Excluded Fields

- **Person ID**: Auto-generated by Airtable formula
- **Providers**: Lookup field (skip for import)
- **Waitlist**: Linked records (skip for import)

## How to Import into Airtable

### Method 1: CSV Import (Recommended)

1. Open your Airtable base
2. Go to the People table
3. Click the dropdown arrow next to the table name
4. Select "Import data" > "CSV file"
5. Upload `people-mock-data.csv`
6. Map the columns to your fields (should auto-match)
7. Click "Import"

**Important Notes**:
- Bed types are stored as **names** (e.g., "Medical Respite – Women,General Adult Beds") which Airtable will automatically link to the correct records in the "Bed Types + Capacity" table
- Airtable will auto-generate `Person ID` based on your formula field
- The import recognizes comma-separated bed type names and creates the proper linked records

### Method 2: Copy-Paste from CSV

1. Open `people-mock-data.csv` in Excel or Google Sheets
2. Select all data (including headers)
3. Copy
4. In Airtable, select the first empty cell in the Full Name column
5. Paste
6. Confirm the import

### Method 3: Using the JSON file

Use the JSON file if you're building an import script with the Airtable API:

```javascript
const people = require("./people-mock-data.json");

// Example: Import using Airtable.js
people.forEach(async (person) => {
  await peopleTable.create(person);
});
```

## Regenerating Mock Data

To regenerate the mock data with different values:

```bash
node scripts/generate-mock-people.js
```

This will create new random data following the same distribution rules.

## Statistics from Current Dataset

Run the generation script to see statistics like:

- Total records
- Status distribution (count & percentage)
- Percentage with pets
- Percentage with vehicles
- Percentage with VI scores
