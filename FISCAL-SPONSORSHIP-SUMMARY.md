# Fiscal Sponsorship Implementation - Summary

## What's Been Created for You

**Date:** October 27, 2025  
**Purpose:** Complete implementation package for establishing fiscal sponsorship structure

---

## Overview

Based on your situation and needs, I've created a comprehensive implementation package for establishing a fiscal sponsorship structure for the Santa Fe Street View project. This approach provides the legal structure and institutional credibility you need while maintaining operational flexibility.

### Why Fiscal Sponsorship?

**Your specific needs:**

- ✓ Providers need to know who legally owns/controls data
- ✓ Requires legal entity to sign HIPAA BAAs with Airtable and Vercel
- ✓ City needs sustainable contracting mechanism beyond emergency contracts
- ✓ You want to maintain hands-on operations for first year
- ✓ Need flexibility to expand to other cities or hand off later

**Fiscal sponsorship delivers all of this:**

- Established nonprofit becomes legal entity
- You operate as Project Director with significant autonomy
- Can be set up in 16-20 weeks (vs. 6-18 months for new nonprofit)
- Costs significantly less than forming independent nonprofit
- Keeps options open for future evolution

## Answering Key Questions

### "Who owns the data?"

**Answer:** The fiscal sponsor is the legal data custodian. You operate the system under their authority. Providers have access rights defined by agreements. This structure provides institutional accountability while you handle day-to-day operations.

### "Who operates the software?"

**Answer:** You do, as Project Director employed/contracted through the fiscal sponsor. The sponsor provides legal structure; you provide all operational execution.

### "Who signs the HIPAA BAAs?"

**Answer:** The fiscal sponsor signs as the legal entity. You implement the HIPAA policies and security measures in practice.

### "How do you get paid sustainably?"

**Answer:** The fiscal sponsor receives City contracts and other funding, then pays you as employee or contractor. Admin fee (8-12%) covers their overhead. Rest goes to project operations including your salary.

### "What if you want to expand to other cities?"

**Answer:** Negotiate intellectual property terms in fiscal sponsorship agreement. Could stay with sponsor and expand, transition to social enterprise, or replicate model elsewhere. Keep options open.

## Success Factors

Based on successful mutual aid and fiscal sponsorship projects:

**Critical Elements:**

1. Find right fiscal sponsor (mission alignment > lowest fee)
2. Confirm HIPAA capability early
3. Negotiate clear operational authority
4. Document everything thoroughly
5. Build provider trust through transparency
6. Maintain mutual aid values within structure
7. Start simple, iterate and improve

**Red Flags to Watch:**

- Sponsor uncertain about HIPAA/BAA capability
- Admin fee significantly higher than 12% without justification
- Sponsor wants excessive operational control
- Opaque or indefinitely delayed decision process
- Poor mission or values alignment
