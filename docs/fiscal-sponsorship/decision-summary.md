# Organizational Structure Decision Summary

## Santa Fe Street View By-Name List Project

**Decision Date:** October 2025  
**Decision:** Pursue Fiscal Sponsorship (Model C)  
**Timeline:** 16-20 weeks to full implementation

---

## The Decision: Fiscal Sponsorship

### What is Fiscal Sponsorship?

An established 501(c)(3) nonprofit (the "fiscal sponsor") serves as the legal entity for the Santa Fe Street View project, while you operate the project with significant autonomy as Project Director.

**In Practice:**

- **They** are the legal entity that signs contracts, owns data (legally), and handles HIPAA Business Associate Agreements
- **You** run day-to-day operations, manage provider relationships, make operational decisions
- **Together** you operate the project under their nonprofit umbrella

### Why This Structure?

**Immediate needs it addresses:**

✓ **Provider Trust:** Providers need to know who legally owns/controls shared data  
✓ **HIPAA Compliance:** Requires legal entity to sign BAAs with Airtable and Vercel  
✓ **City Contracting:** City needs stable entity beyond individual emergency contracts  
✓ **Accountability:** Clear organizational responsibility and governance

**Future flexibility it provides:**

✓ **Foundation Grants:** Immediate access to 501(c)(3) status for grant applications  
✓ **Tax-Deductible Donations:** Public can donate and receive tax deductions  
✓ **Growth Options:** Can expand to other cities or transition to independent nonprofit later  
✓ **Exit Strategy:** Can hand off operations without disrupting the legal structure

## Why Not Other Options?

### ❌ Continue as Individual Contractor

**Problem:**

- Providers uncomfortable sharing HIPAA data with individual
- Cannot sign Business Associate Agreements
- City can't use emergency contracts indefinitely
- No institutional accountability

### ❌ Form New Nonprofit from Scratch

**Problem:**

- Takes 6-18 months for IRS approval
- Costs $3,000-5,000+ in legal fees
- Requires board of directors (shifts power)
- Complex ongoing compliance
- Providers need solution now, not in a year

### ❌ Limited Liability Company (LLC)

**Problem:**

- Not eligible for grants (not a nonprofit)
- Donors can't take tax deductions
- Doesn't provide institutional credibility providers need
- Still just you legally, even if structured

### ✅ Fiscal Sponsorship is the Sweet Spot

**Gets you:**

- Nonprofit status immediately (weeks, not months)
- HIPAA compliance capability
- Institutional credibility
- City contracting ability
- Operational independence
- Foundation grant access
- Lower cost and complexity than forming nonprofit

**While maintaining:**

- Your control over day-to-day operations
- Mutual aid principles and values
- Flexibility to evolve structure later
- Ability to hand off or expand

## How It Works in Practice

### Legal Structure

**[Fiscal Sponsor Name]** ← _Legal entity, data custodian, contract holder_  
↓  
**Santa Fe Street View Project** ← _Program operated under fiscal sponsor_  
↓  
**You (Project Director)** ← _Day-to-day operations and management_

### Money Flow

```
City Contract ($) → Fiscal Sponsor → Your Salary/Project Expenses
Grant Funds ($) → Fiscal Sponsor → Project Operations
Donations ($) → Fiscal Sponsor → Project Use
                ↓
           Admin Fee (8-12%) stays with sponsor
           Rest (88-92%) goes to project
```

### Decision-Making

**You Decide:**

- Day-to-day operations
- Which providers to engage
- How to spend within approved budget
- Community engagement approach
- Technical development priorities
- Provider meeting agendas

**Sponsor Approves:**

- Overall annual budget

- Hiring additional staff

## Answering Provider Questions

**Provider: "Who owns our shared data?"**  
You: "[Fiscal Sponsor Name] is the legal data custodian, a trusted Santa Fe nonprofit. I operate the system under their authority. Here's our data governance document that explains protections."

**Provider: "Who is responsible for HIPAA compliance?"**  
You: "[Fiscal Sponsor Name] has signed Business Associate Agreements with our technology vendors and maintains HIPAA policies. I implement those policies in day-to-day operations."

**Provider: "What if you leave or the project ends?"**  
You: "The legal structure continues through [Fiscal Sponsor Name]. They would either bring in someone new or work with providers on data transition. Your data doesn't disappear."

**Provider: "Is this just you, or a real organization?"**  
You: "It's a real nonprofit - [Fiscal Sponsor Name]. They're the legal organization. I'm the Project Director they've hired to run this program. Same institutional accountability as any nonprofit service."

---

## Answering City Questions

**City: "Why can't we just keep the emergency contracts?"**  
You: "Emergency contracts aren't designed for ongoing programs. A formal contract through a nonprofit provides: (1) better accountability, (2) sustainable funding mechanism, (3) proper legal structure for HIPAA compliance, (4) clear deliverables and metrics."

**City: "Why should we contract with a fiscal sponsor instead of you directly?"**  
You: "Legal and compliance reasons. The system requires HIPAA Business Associate Agreements that individuals can't sign. Providers need organizational accountability, not just an individual contractor. A nonprofit structure provides sustainability beyond any one person."

**City: "Will this cost more?"**  
You: "Slightly - the fiscal sponsor admin fee (10% typically). But you get: established nonprofit accountability, proper legal structure, HIPAA compliance, insurance coverage, and financial management. It's institutional infrastructure the project needs."

**City: "What happens if this doesn't work out?"**  
You: "The fiscal sponsorship agreement has clear exit terms. If I leave, the structure continues and they can bring in someone new. If the project ends, data is handled according to agreements with providers. Much cleaner transition than if I'm just a contractor."

## Maintaining Mutual Aid Principles

**Concern:** "Isn't formal nonprofit structure contrary to mutual aid principles?"

**Reality:** Structure and values are separate questions.

**How to maintain mutual aid principles within fiscal sponsorship:**

✓ **Provider Advisory Committee:** Shared decision-making power  
✓ **Lived Experience Advisory:** Center voices of people experiencing homelessness  
✓ **Transparency:** Open reporting and community accountability  
✓ **Solidarity not Charity:** Language and approach emphasize partnership  
✓ **Non-hierarchical:** Flat team structure (even if legal entity hierarchical)  
✓ **Community Control:** Advisory bodies have real influence on policies

**Key:** The legal entity provides necessary infrastructure. How you operate within it determines whether mutual aid values are upheld.

## Next Steps (This Week)

1. ☐ Make list of 3-5 potential fiscal sponsors in Santa Fe
2. ☐ Customize project brief with your specific details
3. ☐ Reach out to schedule initial conversations
4. ☐ Review organizational-structure.md document for more context
5. ☐ Begin implementation checklist tracking

**Goal:** Initial meetings scheduled by end of this week, fiscal sponsor selected within 6 weeks.

## Questions or Concerns?

This is a significant decision that affects how the project operates for the foreseeable future. It's worth taking time to:

- Talk to other mutual aid projects about their structures
- Meet with multiple potential fiscal sponsors before deciding
- Negotiate terms that preserve your operational autonomy
- Ensure mission and values alignment with your sponsor

**But don't overthink it:** Fiscal sponsorship is specifically designed for projects like this - not ready to be fully independent nonprofits but needing more structure than individual operation.

---

## One-Sentence Summary

**Santa Fe Street View will operate as a program of [Fiscal Sponsor Name], a local 501(c)(3) nonprofit, with Jeremy as Project Director handling all operations - giving us the legal structure providers and the City need while maintaining our mutual aid values and operational flexibility.**
