## Email #1: Initial Outreach (Existing Relationship)

**Use when:** You already know someone at the organization or have an existing relationship

**Subject:** Fiscal Sponsorship Opportunity - Santa Fe Homelessness Coordination Project

---

Hi [Contact Name],

I hope you're doing well! I'm reaching out about an opportunity I think might align well with [Organization Name]'s mission.

I'm working on a By-Name List coordination system for Santa Fe's homeless services providers - essentially a secure platform that enables providers to share appropriate information and coordinate care more effectively. The City is funding this work, and we have initial provider teams committed to participating.

We've reached a point where we need a formal organizational structure to:

- Provide legal entity for HIPAA compliance
- Enable sustainable City contracting
- Give providers confidence in data governance

I'm exploring fiscal sponsorship as the right structure, and [Organization Name] came to mind because of [SPECIFIC REASON - your mission focus on homelessness / your track record with innovative programs / your community credibility / etc.].

**Would you have 30 minutes in the next week or two for a conversation?** I'd love to share more about the project and explore whether this might be a good fit for [Organization Name].

The ask is manageable - we'd operate as a sponsored program under your 501(c)(3), with a standard admin fee covering your services. I'd handle all day-to-day operations.

Let me know if you're interested in learning more!

Best,  
Jeremy

## Email #2: Initial Outreach (Cold Contact)

**Use when:** You don't have an existing relationship with the organization

**Subject:** Inquiry: Fiscal Sponsorship for Homeless Services Coordination Project

---

Dear [Contact Name or "Leadership Team" if no specific contact],

My name is Jeremy [Last Name], and I'm currently coordinating a City-funded project to build a By-Name List system for homeless services in Santa Fe. I'm reaching out to explore whether [Organization Name] might be interested in serving as fiscal sponsor for this work.

**About the Project:**

We're building a HIPAA-compliant coordination platform that enables homeless service providers to share appropriate information, avoid duplication, and track progress toward housing stability. The City of Santa Fe is funding this work, and we have commitment from [X] initial provider organizations to participate.

**Why We Need Fiscal Sponsorship:**

To move from emergency contracts to sustainable structure, we need:

- Legal entity for HIPAA compliance and data governance
- 501(c)(3) status for City contracts and future grants
- Organizational accountability that providers trust

**Why [Organization Name]:**

I'm reaching out to [Organization Name] specifically because [SPECIFIC REASON - your focus on homelessness services / your track record of innovation / your reputation in the provider community / your experience with data projects / etc.].

**What This Would Entail:**

- You'd serve as legal entity; I'd handle all day-to-day operations (Model C fiscal sponsorship)
- City contract funds would flow through your organization (~$100-120K annually)
- Standard admin fee (8-12%) for financial management, insurance, compliance support
- Low administrative burden - we're operationally independent

**Next Step:**

Would you be open to a brief conversation (30 minutes) to explore whether this might be a good fit? I'm happy to share more details and answer any questions.

I can be reached at [your email] or [your phone].

Thank you for considering this opportunity to support innovative homelessness response in Santa Fe.

Best regards,  
Jeremy [Last Name]
