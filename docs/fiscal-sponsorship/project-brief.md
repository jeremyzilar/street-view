# Santa Fe Street View Project

## Project Brief for Potential Fiscal Sponsors

### Executive Summary

Santa Fe Street View is a By-Name List coordination system for homeless services in Santa Fe, New Mexico. We are seeking a fiscal sponsor to provide legal structure, HIPAA compliance capability, and institutional credibility needed to build trust with service providers and secure sustainable City funding.

**Current Status:** Active development with City emergency contract funding ($20k increments)  
**Seeking:** Fiscal sponsorship relationship (Model C preferred)  
**Timeline:** 6-8 weeks to establish agreement  
**Project Director:** Jeremy [Last Name] - committed to hands-on operations for minimum first year

---

### What is the Project?

**Problem:** Santa Fe's homeless service providers operate in silos without a coordinated system to track and assist individuals experiencing homelessness. This leads to duplicated efforts, missed opportunities for intervention, and inability to measure community-wide progress.

**Solution:** A By-Name List system that enables:

- Real-time coordination between homeless service providers
- Individual-level tracking across the service continuum
- Privacy-preserving data sharing with HIPAA compliance
- Actionable insights for providers and city officials
- Mutual aid principles embedded in technology

**Technology:** Custom web application built on:

- Airtable (HIPAA-compliant database)
- Vercel (hosting platform)
- Next.js web framework
- Secure, role-based access controls

**Current Progress:**

- MVP specification defined with provider input
- Initial provider teams identified and engaged
- Emergency contract funding from City ($20k/contract)
- Platform development underway

### Why We Need a Fiscal Sponsor

#### 1. Provider Trust and Legitimacy

Homeless service providers need to know:

- Who legally owns and controls the shared data
- Who is accountable for HIPAA compliance
- What entity they're partnering with (not just an individual)

**Without fiscal sponsor:** Providers hesitant to share data with individual contractor  
**With fiscal sponsor:** Providers partner with established nonprofit they trust

#### 2. HIPAA Compliance

The project requires Business Associate Agreements (BAAs) with:

- Airtable (database platform)
- Vercel (hosting platform)

**Challenge:** Individuals cannot sign BAAs; requires legal entity  
**Solution:** Fiscal sponsor signs BAAs as covered entity

#### 3. Sustainable City Funding

City currently using emergency contracts ($20k increments) which:

- Cannot continue indefinitely
- Don't provide funding stability
- Require complex procurement for each increment

**Better path:** Annual contract or grant through established nonprofit

#### 4. Future Growth Potential

Project could expand to:

- Other New Mexico cities
- Software-as-a-service for other communities
- Foundation grants for innovation
- Individual/public donations

Fiscal sponsorship provides immediate nonprofit status while keeping options open.
