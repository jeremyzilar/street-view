## Key Success Factors

Based on successful mutual aid and fiscal sponsorship projects:

### 1. Find the Right Fiscal Sponsor

- Ask about their experience with similar projects

### 2. Maintain Mutual Aid Principles

- Include lived experience voices in governance

- Focus on solidarity, not charity, in communications
- Build advisory structures from the start

### 3. Center Provider Relationships

- Invest time in trust-building with each provider

## Common Questions

### Do I need a lawyer?

**Recommended but not required for:**

- Reviewing fiscal sponsorship agreement before signing
- Reviewing city contract before signing
- Advising on intellectual property terms if you plan to expand

**Your fiscal sponsor likely has:**

- Legal support they can provide
- Experience with these types of agreements
- Templates and standard language

**Bottom line:** At minimum, have an attorney friend review major agreements. Ideal: consult with nonprofit/contract attorney for fiscal sponsorship agreement.

---

### What if I can't find a fiscal sponsor?

**Options if no one local is interested:**

1. **Expand geographic search:**
   - New Mexico-wide nonprofits
   - National fiscal sponsor organizations (Tides Foundation, etc.)
   - Downside: Less local presence may reduce provider trust

2. **Form simple LLC:**
   - Can sign contracts and BAAs
   - Less ideal for grants and donations
   - See `organizational-structure.md` for LLC details

3. **Partner with existing provider:**
   - They manage contracts and compliance
   - You operate as consultant/contractor to them
   - Clearer MOU about roles and authority

4. **Delay City contract, continue emergency:**
   - Keep building relationships and proving value
   - Try again in 3-6 months with stronger case

---

### How much should I pay myself?

**Factors to consider:**

**Full-time role:** $60,000 - $80,000 (Santa Fe nonprofit sector)
**Part-time/consultant:** $50-75/hour depending on experience

**Consider:**

- Santa Fe cost of living
- Your experience and credentials
- Nonprofit sector norms (lower than tech sector)
- Comparable positions at local nonprofits
- Need to also budget for other roles

**Talk to:**

- Potential fiscal sponsors about typical salaries
- Other nonprofit leaders about local ranges
- City about budget expectations

---

### What if providers still don't trust the structure?

**Additional steps to build trust:**

1. **Invite provider input on policies:**
   - Form Provider Advisory Committee before launch
   - Co-create data governance with their input
   - Let them shape the rules

2. **Transparency measures:**
   - Offer provider tours of systems and security
   - Provide audit logs showing who accessed what
   - Regular accountability reports

3. **Start smaller:**
   - Launch with 2-3 most trusting providers
   - Use their success as proof of concept
   - Others join as they see it working

4. **Individual provider concerns:**
   - One-on-one conversations to understand specific worries
   - Customize data sharing scope to their comfort level
   - Build trust over time

---

### When do I need the individual consent forms?

**Before or at time of data entry:**

- Providers should get consent before adding someone to system
- Use standard consent form (you'll create based on data governance)
- Can be verbal in emergency/street outreach with documentation

**Consent form should explain:**

- What the By-Name List is
- What information will be shared
- Who can access it
- How it will be used
- Individual's rights

**Create consent forms:**

- As part of Step 7 (establish data governance)
- Review with providers before finalizing
- Available in multiple languages if needed
