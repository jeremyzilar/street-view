## Budget Snapshot

Use these figures as you customize materials:

### Estimated Year 1 Budget: $110,000 - $130,000

**Personnel (65-70%):**

- Your compensation: $60,000 - $75,000
- Technical contractors: $15,000 - $25,000
- Additional support: $5,000 - $10,000

- Covers: financial management, insurance, legal entity, compliance

**Funding Sources:**

- City contracts: $80,000 - $100,000
- Foundation grants: $20,000 - $30,000 (target)
- Donations: $5,000 - $10,000 (target)

---

## Common Sticking Points

Issues that come up frequently - be ready for them:

### "That admin fee seems high..."

**Response:** The 8-12% covers critical infrastructure you can't provide as an individual:

- Legal entity to sign HIPAA BAAs
- Insurance ($10K+ value)
- Financial management and reporting
- Nonprofit status for grants
- Institutional accountability

It's not overhead - it's essential capacity.

---

### "How much control will you have vs. the sponsor?"

**Response:** Model C sponsorship means significant operational independence:

- You: Day-to-day decisions, provider relationships, technical choices, spending within budget
- Sponsor: Legal authority, major contracts, budget approval, compliance oversight
- Together: Strategy, major policy changes, hiring additional staff

Define this clearly in your fiscal sponsorship agreement.

---

### "What if it doesn't work out?"

**Response:** Fiscal sponsorship agreements include exit terms:

- Either party can terminate with notice (30-60 days typical)
- Clear process for transitioning data and operations
- Can "graduate" to independent nonprofit if appropriate
- Much cleaner than if you're just individual contractor

## Mental Checklist

### You're Ready When:

✓ You can explain fiscal sponsorship to a provider in 2 minutes  
✓ You have list of 3-5 potential sponsors with contact info  
✓ You've customized the project brief with your information  
✓ You have budget estimates you're comfortable sharing  
✓ You know your availability for meetings over next 2 weeks  
✓ You're clear on what you need (legal entity, HIPAA, accountability)  
✓ You're clear on what you offer (operations, relationships, revenue)

### Signs You're On Track:

✓ Initial meetings scheduled within 2 weeks of outreach  
✓ Potential sponsors are engaged and asking good questions  
✓ You can articulate benefits for both parties  
✓ Timeline feels realistic (not rushed, not dragging)  
✓ You're comparing options, not just hoping anyone says yes

### Red Flags to Watch For:

⚠️ Sponsor seems uncertain about HIPAA/BAA capability  
⚠️ Admin fee significantly higher than 12% without clear justification  
⚠️ Sponsor wants too much operational control  
⚠️ Decision process is opaque or indefinitely delayed  
⚠️ Mission alignment feels forced  
⚠️ Your instincts say "this doesn't feel right"

Trust your judgment. If a potential sponsor isn't a good fit, keep looking.

## Mindset for Success

### Remember:

**You're offering an opportunity.** Fiscal sponsors benefit from:

- Mission-aligned work that advances their goals
- Revenue from admin fees
- Positive visibility and innovation
- Manageable commitment (you handle operations)

**This is a partnership.** You need them, they benefit from you. It's mutual.

**Clarity builds trust.** The more clear you are about what you need and what you offer, the easier it is for them to say yes.

**Take your time with selection.** A good fiscal sponsor relationship can last years. A bad one causes constant friction. Choose carefully.

**Maintain your values.** You can uphold mutual aid principles within formal structure. The legal entity is infrastructure; how you operate determines values.

---

## You've Got This

This might feel overwhelming right now, but you've already done the hard part:

- ✓ Built relationships with providers
- ✓ Secured City funding
- ✓ Proven the concept works
- ✓ Identified the right structure

Now it's just execution. Follow the checklist, use the templates, take it one step at a time.

**In 4 months, you'll have:**

- Established nonprofit structure

- Provider network launched
- Sustainable funding path

**This is achievable.** Many projects have done exactly this. You can too.
