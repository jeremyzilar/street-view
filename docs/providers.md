## How Providers Work Together

Through regular case conferencing and shared information, these providers work collaboratively rather than in silos, ensuring that individuals receive comprehensive support across medical, mental health, shelter, and other critical needs.

- **Coordinated Outreach**: Providers share information about individuals' locations, needs, and preferences to avoid duplication and ensure consistent support.
- **Case Conferencing**: Regular meetings allow providers to discuss complex cases and coordinate responses.
- **Shared Resources**: Providers can refer individuals to appropriate services within the network.
- **Data-Driven Care**: By tracking outcomes and needs, providers can adapt their approaches to be more effective.
