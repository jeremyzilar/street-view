# Organizational Structure: Mutual Aid Framework

## What is Mutual Aid?

Mutual Aid is a framework based on voluntary, reciprocal exchange of resources and services for mutual benefit, operating on principles of solidarity rather than charity.

### Core Principles

- **Non-hierarchical and community-led**: Decision-making power stays with the community
- **Direct action**: Meeting immediate needs without bureaucratic delays
- **Solidarity not charity**: Built on relationships and mutual support, not top-down help
- **Reciprocity**: Everyone has something to give and something to receive
- **Voluntary participation**: Based on choice and commitment, not obligation

## Can Cities and Organizations Fund Mutual Aid Projects?

**Yes, but with important considerations.**

### City Funding

Cities can and do fund mutual aid initiatives, typically through grants or contracts.

**Opportunities:**

- Growing recognition of mutual aid effectiveness (especially post-COVID-19)
- Cities seeking community-driven solutions to homelessness
- Grant programs for innovative approaches
- Service contracts for specific deliverables

**Challenges:**

- Usually requires formal legal structure (nonprofit, fiscal sponsor, or registered entity)
- Reporting requirements and accountability measures
- Must demonstrate specific outcomes or metrics
- Procurement/contracting processes can be slow and bureaucratic
- May require insurance, bonding, or other protections

### Other Funding Sources

**Foundations and Nonprofits:**

- Often enthusiastic about mutual aid's direct-action approach
- Increased interest since 2020
- May have specific mutual aid funding streams

**Private Donors:**

- May prefer mutual aid's grassroots model
- Direct impact appeals to individual donors
- Can use platforms like GoFundMe, Patreon, or direct giving

**Challenges Across Sources:**

- Many funders prefer or require 501(c)(3) status for tax deductions
- Grant applications can be time-consuming
- Reporting requirements vary widely
- Some traditional funders may not understand the model

## Pros and Cons of Mutual Aid Structure

### Advantages

1. **Community Ownership**: Authentic relationships with unhoused neighbors as partners, not clients
2. **Operational Flexibility**: Quick response to needs without waiting for board approval or bureaucratic processes
3. **Lower Overhead**: Reduced administrative burden compared to traditional nonprofits
4. **Trust Building**: Creates solidarity and mutual respect, not dependency
5. **Innovation**: Freedom to experiment and adapt without institutional constraints
6. **Movement Alignment**: Growing visibility and support for mutual aid nationally
7. **Authentic Engagement**: People experiencing homelessness can be equal participants in decision-making

### Challenges

1. **Funding Complexity**: May need fiscal sponsor or formal structure to receive grants
2. **Sustainability Questions**: Can be harder to secure long-term, reliable funding streams
3. **Administrative Burden**: Someone still needs to handle money, reporting, and compliance
4. **Legal Liability**: Need to consider insurance and legal protections for organizers and participants
5. **Scaling Difficulties**: Informal structures can struggle to grow beyond core group
6. **Funder Skepticism**: Some traditional funders may not understand or trust the model
7. **Burnout Risk**: Volunteer-driven work can lead to burnout without sustainable practices

## Legal Structure Options

### 1. Direct to Individual or Informal Group

**How it works:**

- City/funders pay individuals or informal collective directly
- May use contracts for services, stipends, honorariums, or reimbursements

**Pros:**

- Simplest and fastest to set up
- Maximum flexibility and autonomy
- No formation costs or ongoing compliance

**Cons:**

- Individual receives taxable income (1099 reporting)
- Usually limited to smaller amounts
- No liability protection for organizers
- Harder to build institutional relationships
- Banks may question deposits
- Difficult to have multiple people manage funds

**Best for:** Very small-scale, short-term projects or pilot phases

### 2. Limited Liability Company (LLC)

**How it works:**

- Register with state as a business entity
- Can have single member or multiple members
- Requires operating agreement

**Pros:**

- Legal entity separate from individuals
- Liability protection for members
- Can receive contracts and payments
- Simpler than nonprofit to form and maintain
- Flexible management structure
- Can open business bank account

**Cons:**

- Income passes through to members (taxes)
- Formation and annual fees (varies by state)
- Not eligible for many grants (not a nonprofit)
- Donors can't take tax deductions
- Annual state filings required

**Best for:** Projects prioritizing flexibility and simplicity, primarily funded through contracts or earned income

### 3. Nonprofit Corporation / 501(c)(3)

**How it works:**

- Incorporate as nonprofit with state
- Apply for federal tax-exempt status (IRS Form 1023)
- Establish board of directors and governance

**Pros:**

- Tax-exempt status

- IRS restrictions on activities and lobbying
- Public disclosure requirements
- Can take 6-18 months for IRS approval
- Ongoing compliance requirements

**Best for:** Long-term projects seeking foundation grants and institutional funding

### 4. Fiscal Sponsorship

**How it works:**

- Established nonprofit receives funds on your behalf
- You operate your project under their legal umbrella
- They handle compliance, taxes, and reporting

**Types:**

- **Model A (Direct Project)**: Sponsor has full legal control; you're a program of theirs
- **Model C (Pre-approved Grant)**: Sponsor receives and regrants funds; you maintain more independence

**Pros:**

- Fast to set up (weeks, not months)
- Access to 501(c)(3) status immediately
- Sponsor handles legal compliance, insurance, financial reporting
- Donors can take tax deductions
- Operational independence (especially Model C)
- No need to form board of directors
- Can "graduate" to independent nonprofit later

**Cons:**

- Administrative fee (typically 5-15%)
- Need to find compatible sponsor
- Sponsor has ultimate legal control
- Must align with sponsor's mission
- Sponsor's reputation affects your project
- May have restrictions on activities

**Best for:** Projects wanting to stay nimble while accessing institutional funding; testing concept before forming independent nonprofit

**Finding Fiscal Sponsors:**

- Local community foundations
- Homeless services nonprofits
- Mutual aid networks
- National organizations (Fractured Atlas, Tides Foundation, etc.)

## Hybrid Approaches

You don't have to choose just one model. Consider:

### Partnership Model

- City funds data infrastructure and technology
- Mutual aid network coordinates community engagement and direct services
- Formal entity (nonprofit or fiscal sponsor) manages city funds
- Informal collective manages grassroots fundraising and volunteer coordination

### Network Approach

- Become the mutual aid backbone connecting existing services
- Don't provide direct services; coordinate and amplify others
- Lighter structure requirements
- Focus on information sharing and community organizing

### Principle-Based Regardless of Structure

- Use mutual aid principles (transparency, community voice, solidarity) within any legal structure
- Even as a formal nonprofit, you can operate with mutual aid values:
  - Include people with lived experience in governance
  - Keep decision-making transparent and participatory
  - Focus on solidarity and reciprocity, not charity
  - Maintain horizontal rather than hierarchical relationships

## Considerations for Santa Fe Context

### Questions to Investigate

**City Funding:**

1. Does Santa Fe contract with individuals or informal groups?
2. What are procurement thresholds and requirements?
3. Do they require insurance, bonding, or specific certifications?
4. Are they offering grants (usually need nonprofit) or contracts (more flexible)?
5. What reporting and accountability measures are required?

**Local Ecosystem:**

1. Are there local nonprofits that offer fiscal sponsorship?
2. What is the city's relationship with existing homeless services providers?
3. Are there active mutual aid networks in Santa Fe?
4. What is the political climate around homelessness and mutual aid?

**Community Landscape:**

1. How do people experiencing homelessness want to be engaged?
2. What existing organizing or advocacy groups could be partners?
3. What is the appetite for participatory, community-led approaches?

### Santa Fe Resources to Explore

## Recommendations

### Immediate Next Steps

1. **Clarify the vision**:
   - How important is maintaining pure mutual aid principles vs. accessing institutional funding?
   - What level of formality can you sustain with current capacity?

2. **Research specific opportunities**:
   - Contact Santa Fe to understand their funding mechanisms and requirements
   - Identify potential fiscal sponsors or partner organizations
   - Talk to other mutual aid projects about their structures

3. **Start simple, evolve as needed**:
   - **Phase 1**: Launch informally, test the model, build relationships
   - **Phase 2**: Add fiscal sponsor when ready for institutional funding
   - **Phase 3**: Consider independent nonprofit if/when it makes sense

### Recommended Path for This Project

- **Solidarity Not Charity**: Framework and principles resource
- **Community Centric Fundraising**: Values-aligned fundraising approach

## Conclusion

The mutual aid framework can strengthen this project by centering community voice, building authentic relationships, and maintaining flexibility. However, to receive institutional funding (especially from the city), you'll likely need some formal structure—at minimum, a fiscal sponsor.

The key is maintaining mutual aid **principles** (solidarity, reciprocity, community leadership) regardless of your legal structure. You can operate as a formal nonprofit and still embody mutual aid values through inclusive governance, transparent operations, and horizontal relationships.

Start with the simplest structure that meets your needs, and evolve as the project grows.
