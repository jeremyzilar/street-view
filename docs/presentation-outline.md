# Many Paths: Supporting People's Journeys to Stable, Safe, and Healthy Lives

## Presentation Outline (Pyramid Principle Structure)

**Date:** [To be scheduled]  
**Audience:** [Santa Fe community members / providers / city officials / funders]  
**Duration:** 10-15 minutes  
**Format:** 9-10 slides

---

## Main Message (Pyramid Top)

**"Santa Fe can better support people experiencing homelessness by coordinating our efforts through a shared system that connects providers, respects individual paths, and engages our community in meaningful solutions."**

---

## Supporting Pillar 1: The Problem We're Solving

### Why Coordination Matters

**Situation: Santa Fe has resources, but they're disconnected**

- Multiple providers serving the same people without shared visibility
- No coordinated view of who needs what services
- People fall through cracks between organizations
- Providers duplicate efforts or miss collaboration opportunities
- Community lacks transparency into what's actually happening

**Impact: People struggle to access the support they need**

- People's paths to stability take longer without coordination
- Resources aren't used as efficiently as they could be
- Provider burnout from working in silos
- Community disconnected from the reality and progress
- Missed opportunities for intervention and support
- Individual goals and preferences get lost in the shuffle

**The Core Problem:** We're all working hard, but not always working together or listening to what people actually need.

## Questions to Anticipate

**Q: What about privacy and HIPAA compliance?**
A: Built-in from day one. Secure platform, consent required, local nonprofit as data custodian, providers only see what they need.

**Q: How much does it cost?**
A: [City contract of $X covers operations and technology. Sustainable investment in coordinated support.]

**Q: What if providers don't want to participate?**
A: Voluntary participation. We're starting with willing partners and proving value. As coordination helps people get housed faster, others will want to join.

**Q: Who controls the data?**
A: Local nonprofit (Life Link or similar) is legal data custodian. Providers contribute data. Individuals provide consent. Everyone follows clear data governance policies.

**Q: How is this different from [existing system]?**
A: [Be prepared to contrast with HMIS or other local tools. Emphasize coordination vs. just data collection, public engagement component, real-time nature, mobile-friendly, etc.]

**Q: What happens if this doesn't work?**
A: We're starting with a pilot to prove value. Clear metrics to track. Low risk because we're using existing providers and proven technology model. Can adjust based on what we learn.

**Remember:** You're not asking permission to try something new. You're inviting people to join something that's already proven to work elsewhere and starting to work here. The name "Many Paths" reminds us that success looks different for different people - our job is to coordinate support for each person's journey, not impose a single definition of success. Confidence, clarity, respect, and invitation are key.
