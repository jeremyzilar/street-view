## About Many Paths

Many Paths SF is a collaborative initiative bringing together service providers, outreach teams, healthcare workers, and community partners in Santa Fe to create a coordinated response to street homelessness.

## Our Approach

We believe that addressing homelessness requires more than individual organizations working in isolation. Many Paths operates on a **collective care** model where:

- Information is shared (with consent) among trusted partners
- Providers coordinate their efforts to avoid duplication
- Individual autonomy and choice are respected
- Everyone experiencing street homelessness is known and can access support

## Who Participates

Many Paths brings together organizations and individuals from across Santa Fe's homelessness response ecosystem:

### Service Providers

Organizations providing direct services including shelter, housing navigation, case management, and support services.

### Street Outreach Teams

Teams that build relationships with people living unsheltered, providing supplies, connection to services, and advocacy.

### Healthcare Partners

Medical and mental health providers working with people experiencing homelessness, including community health workers and clinic staff.

### City Partners

City of Santa Fe departments working on homelessness response, housing, and community services.

### Community Members

Volunteers and community members who support the work through various roles.

## Our Commitment

We are committed to:

- **Knowing everyone** experiencing street homelessness in Santa Fe
- **Coordinating our response** through regular case conferencing
- **Respecting individual autonomy** and meeting people where they are
- **Protecting privacy** while enabling effective care coordination
