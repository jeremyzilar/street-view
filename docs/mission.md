The Many Paths Project fills the critical gap between existing systems
for supporting people experiencing street homelessness. Through
collective care we help people experiencing street homelessness who
are needing medical help, shelter, and support on their way to stable
housing.

## Our Purpose

Many Paths is dedicated to supporting people experiencing street homelessness in Santa Fe through collective care coordination. Our mission is to know everyone, coordinate provider response, and respect individual autonomy while filling the critical gap between existing systems.

## What We Do

- **Fill the Gap**: We track people experiencing street homelessness who fall between UniteUS, Life Link waitlists, and HMIS—creating an accurate, real-time picture of homelessness in Santa Fe.

- **Collective Care Coordination**: Through regular case conferencing, providers coordinate responses based on individual needs and preferences, working together instead of in silos.

- **Respect Every Path**: We track diverse needs—medical, mental health, seasonal shelter, ID, ADA accessibility—and respect that some people don't want shelter, and that's okay.

- **Tell the True Story**: We use aggregated data to advocate for resources and show the public the real scope of homelessness, not just who's in HMIS.

## Our Values

### Dignity and Respect

Every person deserves to be treated with dignity and respect, regardless of their housing status. We approach our work with compassion and without judgment.
