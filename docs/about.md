deck: Building public infrastructure for coordinated homeless services

## What We're Building

The Many Paths Project is creating a replicable, open platform for coordinated homeless services—a "public option" for cities that want to know everyone experiencing street homelessness by name and coordinate care effectively.

Instead of every city paying consultants millions to build the same systems over and over, we're creating infrastructure that can be deployed anywhere:

- **Many Paths SF** - Santa Fe, New Mexico (pilot)
- **Many Paths ABQ** - Albuquerque (planned)
- **Many Paths [Your City]** - Replicable model for any community

This isn't proprietary software owned by vendors. It's civic infrastructure that cities can own, adapt, and maintain.

## Our Approach

### Decentralized Eligibility Verification

We don't believe in distant agencies determining who needs help. The Many Paths Project empowers **trusted community providers** to serve as decentralized verifiers of need—like notaries for eligibility.

Organizations like HUGS, MIHO, SouthWest Cares, and The Life Link work directly with people experiencing homelessness every day. They know who needs support. Our platform amplifies their expertise rather than replacing it with bureaucracy.

This decentralized model:

- Keeps decision-making close to communities
- Respects provider knowledge and relationships
- Prevents the creation of sprawling, vulnerable centralized databases
- Enables coordination without creating surveillance systems

### People, Process, Collaboration—Not AI Magic

The Many Paths Project is grounded in a simple belief: **technology serves people, not the other way around.**

We're not building AI systems that claim to predict who will become homeless or algorithmically rank people's worthiness for services. We're building tools that help real people—outreach workers, case managers, housing navigators—do their jobs better through better coordination.

Our focus is on:

- **People**: Training, supporting, and empowering service providers
- **Process**: Collaborative case conferencing and shared protocols
- **Collaboration**: Breaking down silos between organizations

Technology is the infrastructure that makes collaboration possible, not a replacement for human relationships and judgment.

### Data Minimization by Design

We collect only what's necessary for coordination. No more, no less.

When someone achieves stability, we purge identifying information. We design for data ephemerality, not permanent records. We ask providers: "What's the minimum data we need?" not "What data could we collect?"

This isn't just about privacy—it's about security, trust, and building systems that are resilient against abuse by design.

## Why This Matters

Right now, people experiencing street homelessness are largely invisible to existing systems:

- **UniteUS** doesn't capture people living on the streets
- **HMIS** only captures people once they enter shelters
- **The gap in between** is where people fall through the cracks

That gap is where The Many Paths Project operates. We help providers track everyone by name, coordinate services in real time, and ensure no one gets lost in the shuffle.

## How It Works

### For Service Providers (Private)

- **Shared by-name list** across participating organizations
- **Case conferencing tools** for coordinated care planning
- **Activity tracking** for transparency and accountability
- **Mobile-friendly** access for outreach workers
- **HIPAA-compliant** with clear data governance

### For the Community (Public)

- **Transparent dashboard** showing aggregate data (never individual information)
- **Donation coordination** connecting community resources to real needs
- **Provider directory** helping people find services
- **Real stories** (with consent) about paths to stability

---

## Our Principles

1. **Coordination over silos** - Providers working together achieve better outcomes
2. **Dignity and consent** - Individuals control their information and participate in decisions
3. **Many paths, not one path** - Success looks different for different people
4. **Transparency** - Communities deserve to see reality and progress
5. **Sustainability** - Technology and operations must be sustainable long-term
6. **Scalability** - Solutions should work in multiple communities
7. **Privacy and security** - Secure, HIPAA-compliant, respectful of sensitive data
