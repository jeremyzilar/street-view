# About The Many Paths Project

**Coordinating care for people experiencing homelessness in Santa Fe**

---

## The Problem

Right now in Santa Fe, people experiencing street homelessness often fall through the cracks between systems:

- **UniteUS** doesn't capture people living on the streets
- **HMIS** only tracks people once they enter shelters
- Each provider organization only sees their own piece of the picture

When no one has the full picture, people get lost in the gaps. Efforts get duplicated. Critical information doesn't make it from one provider to another.

---

## What We Do

The Many Paths Project helps service providers coordinate care by maintaining a **shared by-name list** of everyone experiencing street homelessness in Santa Fe.

This shared list helps providers:

- Know who is currently on the streets and what support they need
- Coordinate services without duplicating efforts
- Track what's been tried and what's working
- Make case conferencing meetings more effective
- Ensure no one falls through the cracks

## How It Works

### For Service Providers (Private)

Participating organizations share information through a secure platform:

- **By-name list** showing everyone currently experiencing street homelessness
- **Case notes and coordination** visible to providers with consent
- **Mobile-friendly** so outreach workers can update information in the field
- **HIPAA-compliant** with clear data governance and security
- **Case conferencing tools** to support your regular coordination meetings

### For the Community (Public)

Transparency matters. The public website shows:

- **Aggregate data** about homelessness in Santa Fe (never individual information)
- **Current needs** for donations (clothing, food, supplies)
- **Provider directory** so people can find help
- **Real progress** toward supporting people on their paths to stability

## Our Approach

### Human-Centered, Not Algorithm-Driven

We're not building AI to predict homelessness or algorithms to rank people. We're building practical tools to help outreach workers, case managers, and housing navigators do their jobs better through better coordination.

Technology supports people—it doesn't replace them.

### Providers Know Best

Organizations like HUGS, MIHO, SouthWest Cares, and The Life Link work directly with people experiencing homelessness every day. They know who needs help and what kind of support works.

Our platform amplifies their expertise and helps them work together more effectively. We're not replacing their judgment with bureaucracy.

### Collect Only What's Needed

We only track information that's actually necessary for coordination. When someone achieves stability and services end, we remove their identifying information.

This isn't just about privacy—it's about building trust and creating systems that don't become surveillance tools.

### Built to Last

This isn't a short-term grant project. We're building sustainable infrastructure that Santa Fe can own and maintain long-term, with proper governance through fiscal sponsorship.

## Our Principles

1. **Coordination over silos** - Providers working together achieve better outcomes
2. **Dignity and consent** - Individuals control their information and participate in decisions
3. **Many paths, not one path** - Success looks different for different people
4. **Transparency** - Communities deserve to see reality and progress
5. **Privacy and security** - Secure, HIPAA-compliant, respectful of sensitive data
6. **Sustainability** - Built to last, not dependent on a single person or short-term funding

## Sharing What We Learn

While we're focused on Santa Fe, we're documenting what we learn so other communities don't have to start from scratch:

- Implementation guides for by-name lists
- Data governance frameworks that balance coordination with privacy
- Best practices from case conferencing
- Lessons learned - what worked and what didn't
