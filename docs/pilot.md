title: By-Name List Pilot
deck: A collaborative tool to support your work with people experiencing street homelessness
---

You're already doing critical work through your bi-weekly case conferencing meetings—bringing providers together to coordinate care for people experiencing homelessness with complex needs. **The Many Paths Project is here to support and amplify that work**.

## Overview

The Many Paths Project is a collective care coordination platform designed to:

- Help service providers log and share critical information about people experiencing street homelessness who need shelter, services, or support. This information is private to providers in the network, enabling coordinated care while protecting privacy.
- Make it easier to coordinate donations and services from organizations, donors, and the public—everything from home goods to food to other essential items.

### The Problem We're Solving

Right now, people living on the streets are largely invisible to the systems designed to help them. They're not tracked, not counted, and their needs aren't documented anywhere. This creates several critical gaps:

- **We don't know who is on the streets** experiencing homelessness at any given time
- **We don't have data on what they need** to achieve stable, healthy lives
- **Providers can't coordinate effectively** when each organization only sees their own piece of the puzzle
- **People fall through the cracks** when there's no shared visibility across providers

Existing systems don't capture this population:

**UniteUS** is designed to connect people with critical services, but it doesn't capture people living on the streets.

**HMIS** (Homeless Management Information System) only captures people once they've entered shelters like The Life Link, completely missing everyone living unsheltered on the streets.

**That gap—tracking people on the streets before they access these systems—is where The Many Paths Project operates.** Your clients are in this gap right now, and you're working hard to help them navigate these barriers. The Many Paths Project is designed to support that coordination work.

## Why a By-Name List is Essential

### The Challenge Without It

When each organization maintains their own records:

- **People fall through the cracks** when no one knows the full picture of who's being served
- **Efforts get duplicated** when multiple providers don't know others are already engaged
- **Progress gets lost** when someone moves between service areas or providers
- **Case conferencing relies on memory** rather than comprehensive, up-to-date information
- **New staff can't quickly understand** the history and complexity of each case
- **Coordination happens reactively** rather than proactively
- We lack the data needed to truly engage with the City and fundraising supporters

### The Power of a Shared By-Name List

With a shared system, your case conferencing becomes more effective:

- **Know everyone by name** who needs coordinated support across all your organizations
- **See the full picture** of services, attempts, barriers, and goals in one place
- **Prevent people from falling through gaps** between providers and systems
- **Make case conferencing more efficient** with everyone looking at the same information
- **Track what's been tried** so you don't repeat unsuccessful approaches
- **Coordinate in real-time** between meetings when urgent situations arise
- **Measure your collective impact** and demonstrate outcomes to funders
- **Onboard new staff quickly** with comprehensive case histories

### Evidence from the Field

This approach isn't new—it's proven. **Built for Zero**, a national initiative, has helped over 100 communities use by-name lists to dramatically reduce homelessness. Communities using this approach report:

- Faster connections to housing and services
- Better coordination across providers
- Fewer people falling through the cracks
- More efficient use of limited resources
- Stronger cases for funding based on real data

The difference is that Many Paths is designed specifically for the city of Santa Fe, with features tailored to their providers.

## The Ask

We're inviting HUGS, MIHO, and SouthWest Cares to pilot this tool together. Here's what we're asking:

### 1. Participate in Collaborative Design

**Workshop during the week of November 10th** (specific date/time to be scheduled)

We need your expertise to design this right. In this working session, we'll:

- Discuss what information is essential for effective case conferencing
- Decide together what data fields to capture for each person
- Design workflows that fit how you actually work
- Address concerns and questions about privacy and governance
- Create a system that serves your needs, not ours

**Your input is essential.** You understand your clients and your work better than anyone. We're not bringing you a finished product—we're inviting you to co-create a tool that actually helps.

### 2. Use the Tool for Your Case Conferencing

Once we've designed the system together:

- **Add your high-risk clients** to the shared by-name list
- **Update information** as circumstances change
- **Reference the list** during your bi-weekly case conferencing meetings
- **Use it for coordination** between meetings when needed

The system will be:

- Easy to use (web-based, mobile-friendly)
- Respectful of your time (quick updates, not bureaucratic data entry)
- Supportive of your existing workflows (not replacing what works)

### 3. Help Us Learn and Improve

This is a pilot—which means we're learning together. We're asking you to:

- **Provide honest feedback** about what's working and what's not
- **Suggest improvements** based on your real-world experience
- **Participate in brief check-ins** (monthly during the pilot)
- **Share your perspective** on how the tool affects your work

We expect to make adjustments based on what we learn from you. Your feedback will shape not just this pilot, but how Many Paths serves Santa Fe going forward.

### 4. Commit to the Pilot Period

We're proposing a **3-6 month pilot** to truly test whether this supports your work. That's enough time to:

- Build the habit of using the system
- See it work through multiple case conferencing cycles
- Experience the benefits of real-time coordination
- Provide meaningful feedback for improvement

We understand this is a commitment. We're committed too—to making this genuinely useful for your work, not just another system to manage.

---

## How It Will Work

### Phase 1: Collaborative Design (Week of November 10th)

**Workshop Session** (2-3 hours)

Together we'll work through:

1. **Who goes on the list?**
   - Criteria for high-risk clients who benefit from multi-provider coordination
   - How people get added and removed

2. **What information do we track?**
   - Essential demographics and contact information
   - Service history and current supports
   - Goals, barriers, and assessed needs
   - What NOT to track (avoiding unnecessary data)

3. **Who can see what?**
   - Access levels for different roles
   - Consent and privacy considerations
   - How information flows between organizations

4. **How does it integrate with case conferencing?**
   - Preparing for meetings using the list
   - Documenting decisions and action items
   - Following up between meetings

5. **What makes this sustainable?**
   - How much time does it take?
   - Who updates what, and when?
   - How do we maintain data quality?

### Phase 2: Setup and Training (Early December)

Once we've designed the system together:

- **Technical setup** (1 week)
  - We'll build the data structure based on workshop decisions
  - Create user accounts with appropriate access levels
  - Import any existing data you want to include

- **Training sessions** (1-2 hours per organization)
  - Hands-on practice with the system
  - How to add and update information
  - Mobile access for field work
  - Troubleshooting and support contacts

### Phase 3: Pilot Launch (December 2025 - March/May 2026)

- **Begin using the system** for your case conferencing

- **Monthly Retrospective Meetings** (60-90 minutes)

  These are structured learning sessions where we review the pilot together:

  **What We'll Discuss:**
  - What's working well? (Keep doing this)
  - What's not working? (Stop doing this)
  - What can be improved? (Start doing this)
  - Critical system changes needed
  - Emerging needs or patterns
  - Adjustments to workflows or data fields

  **Why Monthly?**
  - Frequent enough to address issues quickly
  - Enough time between meetings to test changes
  - Builds in continuous improvement from the start

  **The Outcome:**
  - Clear action items for system improvements
  - Shared understanding of what's being prioritized
  - Documentation of what we're learning together
  - Transparency about what changes are coming and why

  These aren't reporting meetings where you justify your use—they're collaborative problem-solving sessions to make the tool better.

- **Ongoing support**
  - Direct access to the project coordinator (Jeremy) for questions
  - Quick response to technical issues
  - Continuous improvements based on your feedback

### Phase 4: Evaluation and Next Steps (End of Pilot)

Together we'll assess:

- Did this make case conferencing more effective?
- Did it improve outcomes for clients?
- Is this worth continuing and expanding?
- What would need to change for long-term use?

Based on what we learn, we'll decide together whether to continue, expand to other providers, or adapt the approach.

## How the Data is Governed

We know that trust is essential when sharing sensitive client information. Here's how we ensure data is protected and used appropriately.

### Core Governance Principles

1. **Individual Rights and Consent**

   We need to design a consent approach that respects individual autonomy while being practical for real-world coordination. In the workshop, we'll discuss:
   - What consent processes are realistic given your work?
   - How can we inform people about data sharing?
   - What protections matter most to you and your clients?
   - Are there situations where coordination needs to happen without prior consent?

   Options might include opt-out approaches, tiered access levels, provider-level consent, or other models. We'll design this together based on what actually works.

2. **Collect Only What's Needed**
   - We'll only track information that actually supports coordination
   - No "nice to have" fields that don't serve a purpose
   - Regular reviews to remove unnecessary data

3. **Clear Purpose and Limits**
   - Data is used solely for coordinating care and services
   - Not for law enforcement, immigration, or punitive purposes
   - Not for research without separate consent
   - Not sold or shared with third parties

### HIPAA Compliance

Because this involves health information:

- The platform will be **HIPAA-compliant**
- We're establishing a fiscal sponsor who will serve as the legal data custodian
- Business Associate Agreements will be in place with technology vendors (Airtable, hosting providers)
- Technical safeguards include encryption, secure authentication, and audit logs
- Provider organizations will sign Data Sharing Agreements defining responsibilities

### Data Security Measures

- **Encrypted** data storage and transmission
- **Password-protected** access with two-factor authentication options
- **Role-based access**—you only see what you need to see
- **Audit trails** tracking who accessed what information and when
- **Regular backups** to prevent data loss
- **Incident response plan** if a breach occurs

### Provider Input on Governance

You'll have a voice in how data is governed:

- The workshop will include discussion of governance policies
- Provider feedback will shape data sharing agreements
- Regular check-ins will address governance concerns
- Advisory structure (to be developed) will include provider representatives

### What Happens to the Data Long-Term?

- Individual data is retained only as long as someone is receiving coordinated services
- After someone achieves stability and services end, identifying information is removed
- Aggregate data may be retained for reporting and evaluation
- If the pilot doesn't continue, data will be returned to providers or securely deleted per your preferences

---

## Who Gets Access to the Data

Access is carefully controlled to protect privacy while enabling coordination.

### Access Levels

**Participating Case Conferencing Providers (HUGS, MIHO, SouthWest Cares):**

- Access levels and consent requirements will be designed in the workshop
- Likely includes ability to see and update information about people your organization serves
- Coordination information may be visible across providers (specific rules to be determined)
- Can add case notes and document services
- The workshop will determine what level of consent or notification is practical

**System Administrator (Many Paths):**

- Technical access to maintain the system
- Can see data for troubleshooting and quality assurance
- Bound by same privacy and security requirements

**Public:**

- **No access** to individual-level information
- May see aggregate statistics (total number served, demographic trends, outcomes) with all identifying information removed

### What You Cannot See

Even with access, there are boundaries:

- Certain case notes may be private to individual organizations
- Bulk data export will be controlled
- Access levels will be designed to enable coordination while protecting privacy

### Individual Rights

We'll design a system that respects individual rights while enabling effective coordination:

- Right to know what information is collected
- Right to access their own information
- Right to request corrections to inaccurate information
- Right to revoke consent and have their information removed
- Right to consent to some providers but not others

### Audit and Accountability

- All data access is logged with timestamps and user identification
- Regular audits ensure access is appropriate
- Violations of privacy policies result in immediate access revocation
- Providers are accountable to their organizations' own policies and to the shared data governance agreement

### Activity Stream and Transparency

To build trust and accountability among partners, the system includes a visible activity stream showing key actions:

**What You'll See:**

- "James (HUGS) added a new person to the list"
- "Maria (MIHO) updated contact information for John Doe"
- "Sarah (SouthWest Cares) added a case note"
- "System Administrator updated access permissions"

**Why This Matters:**

- **Trust through transparency**: Everyone can see who is actively using and updating the system
- **Coordination awareness**: Know when others have updated information you're tracking
- **Accountability**: Actions are visible, not hidden
- **Activity tracking**: Understand which organizations are most engaged

**What's NOT Shown Publicly:**

- The activity stream shows _actions_ but not necessarily the _content_ of those actions
- Detailed case notes remain visible only to those with appropriate access
- The stream respects the same privacy boundaries as the rest of the system

**Privacy Balance:**

This activity visibility will be part of our workshop discussion on November 10th. We'll work through:

- What level of activity detail is helpful vs. intrusive?
- Should all actions be visible, or only certain types?
- How does this affect provider comfort and trust?

## Who Will Run the Software + Organizational Structure + Funding

We want to be transparent about how this project is organized and sustained.

### Current Status: Building Sustainable Structure

Many Paths is in the process of establishing formal organizational structure. Here's where we are:

**Fiscal Sponsorship Model:**

We're identifying a fiscal sponsor—an established nonprofit that will:

- Serve as the legal entity operating Many Paths
- Sign HIPAA Business Associate Agreements
- Hold contracts and receive funding
- Provide institutional accountability and credibility

We've identified several strong candidates and are in conversations. The fiscal sponsor will be finalized before the pilot launches.

**Why Fiscal Sponsorship?**

This structure provides:

- **Legal entity** that providers and the City can trust
- **HIPAA compliance** with proper legal agreements
- **Sustainability** through formal contracting and grant eligibility
- **Operational independence** so the project stays nimble and responsive
- **Institutional backing** without creating a large new bureaucracy

### Who Does What

**Fiscal Sponsor (Nonprofit Partner):**

- Legal data custodian
- Signs contracts and agreements
- Provides financial management and oversight
- Ensures HIPAA and legal compliance

**Project Director (Jeremy Zilar):**

- Day-to-day operations and coordination
- Technical development and maintenance
- Direct support to providers
- Facilitates case conferencing tools
- Manages pilot implementation

**Provider Partners (You):**

- Use the system for case conferencing
- Update client information
- Provide feedback and guidance
- Help shape governance and policies
- Collaborate on continuous improvement

**Advisory Structure (To Be Developed):**

- Provider representatives
- People with lived experience of homelessness
- Community stakeholders
- Guide strategic direction

### Technology Infrastructure

**Platform:**

- Built with Next.js (modern web framework)
- Airtable database (secure, flexible, HIPAA-compliant with BAA)
- Hosted on secure servers with encryption
- Mobile-responsive for field access

**Support:**

- Direct access to technical support
- Regular updates and improvements
- Training and onboarding for new users

### Funding and Sustainability

**Current Funding:**

- Initial development funded through emergency City contracts
- Transitioning to sustainable funding model

**Sustainable Funding Path:**

- City of Santa Fe contracts for coordinated care services
- Foundation grants focused on homelessness innovation
- Potential grants from healthcare and social service funders
- Long-term goal: multi-year City funding as essential infrastructure

**Cost to Participating Providers:**

- **Free for the pilot**—no cost to your organizations
- Long-term funding model to be determined based on pilot success
- Goal is City-funded as public infrastructure, not provider cost

### Long-Term Vision

If the pilot proves valuable:

- Expand to additional providers across Santa Fe
- Develop additional features based on provider needs
- Create a sustainable model that outlasts any single person or organization
- Potentially replicate in other communities facing similar challenges

### What If the Pilot Doesn't Work?

Transparency matters here too:

- If the pilot shows this doesn't help your work, we won't force it
- Your data will be returned to you or deleted per your preference
- We'll document what we learned for future efforts
- No long-term obligation to continue

## We Need You

Case conferencing works because you bring your expertise, compassion, and commitment to supporting people with complex needs. A by-name list is just a tool—the real power comes from how you use it to coordinate care.

We're not trying to replace your judgment or your relationships with clients. We're trying to give you better information so those relationships can be even more effective.

This pilot only works if it genuinely supports your work. We need your honesty, your expertise, and your willingness to experiment with us.

## Appendix: Common Questions

### "We're already overwhelmed. Will this add more work?"

We hear you. The goal is to save time, not add burden. A shared list means:

- Less time hunting for information before meetings
- Fewer duplicate efforts across organizations
- Quicker onboarding when someone new joins your team
- Better decisions with better information

But we'll only know if it achieves that by trying it. If it's adding work without value, we need to hear that and adjust.

### "How will consent and data sharing work?"

We need to find an approach that respects individual rights while being practical for real-world coordination. Options might include opt-out approaches, provider-level consent, or other models. The important thing is that it actually works for how you operate.

### "What about people we serve who aren't experiencing homelessness?"

Many Paths is specifically designed for coordinating care for people experiencing street homelessness. If you serve other populations, those clients wouldn't be included in this shared list.

### "Can we start small?"

Absolutely. Start with a few clients you're already discussing in case conferencing. Build from there as it proves useful. No need to migrate everything at once.

### "What if the fiscal sponsorship doesn't work out?"

We're committed to having a fiscal sponsor in place before launching the pilot. If for some reason that falls through, we'd pause the pilot rather than proceed without proper legal structure.

### "How is this different from HMIS?"

HMIS is primarily for HUD reporting and captures people once they're in shelters. Many Paths focuses on street homelessness and real-time care coordination, not federal reporting. They serve different purposes, though eventually there might be data sharing between them.

### "What if only one or two organizations want to participate?"

The value of a shared list grows with more participants, but even two organizations coordinating is better than none. We'd like all three, but we'll work with whoever sees value in this.

### "Can we back out if it's not working?"

Yes. This is a pilot, not a permanent commitment. If it's not serving you, we need to know that. There's no penalty or judgment for deciding it's not the right tool.

**Thank you for considering this partnership. The work you do changes lives. We hope Many Paths can help you do even more.**
