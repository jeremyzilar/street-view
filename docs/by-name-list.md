title: By-Name List
deck: Knowing everyone experiencing street homelessness by name to ensure coordinated care and support
---

A by-name list is exactly what it sounds like: a real-time list of everyone experiencing street homelessness in Santa Fe, tracked **by name** so that service providers can coordinate care and ensure no one falls through the cracks.

Instead of relying on rough estimates or each organization maintaining their own records, a by-name list gives all participating providers a shared, up-to-date view of who needs support, what services they're receiving, and how we can work together to help them achieve stability.

## Why It Matters

### The Problem Without a By-Name List

When providers don't have a shared view:

- **People get lost in the gaps** between organizations and systems
- **Efforts get duplicated** when multiple providers don't know others are already engaged
- **Critical information doesn't transfer** when someone moves between service areas
- **We can't measure progress** because we don't know who we're actually serving
- **Case conferencing relies on memory** instead of comprehensive data

### The Power of Knowing Everyone

With a shared by-name list:

- **Everyone is known** - No one is invisible to the system
- **Coordination improves** - Providers can see who's working with whom
- **Progress is tracked** - We know what's working and what isn't
- **Resources are allocated better** - We can identify gaps and prioritize support
- **Case conferencing becomes more effective** - Meetings are based on complete, current information

## How It Works in Santa Fe

### For Service Providers

The by-name list is maintained through The Many Paths Project platform, where participating organizations can:

- **Add people** they encounter during outreach or services
- **Update information** about current living situations, needs, and services received
- **Coordinate care** by seeing who else is providing support
- **Track progress** toward individual goals and stability
- **Use in case conferencing** to discuss complex cases with complete information

All information is:

- **Secure and HIPAA-compliant** with proper safeguards
- **Private to participating providers** - not visible to the public
- **Mobile-friendly** for outreach workers in the field

### What Information is Tracked

The by-name list captures only what's necessary for effective coordination:

- **Basic information**: Name, date of birth, contact information
- **Current situation**: Where they're staying, immediate needs
- **Services and support**: What organizations are providing help
- **Goals and barriers**: What they're working toward and what's in the way
- **Consent and preferences**: Who can access their information

We collect only the data thats actually needed, not just what sounds useful.

## The By-Name List Pilot

The Many Paths Project is currently piloting the by-name list with a handful of providers in Santa Fe.

**This pilot will:**

- Test the by-name list approach with providers who coordinate complex cases
- Design the data structure collaboratively with participating organizations
- Establish data governance and consent practices
- Refine the tool based on real-world use
- Demonstrate value before expanding to additional providers

## Built for Zero Methodology

The by-name list approach is proven. Communities across the country using **Built for Zero** methodology have dramatically reduced homelessness by:

1. **Knowing everyone by name** in real time
2. **Coordinating housing and services** across providers
3. **Using data to drive decisions** about resource allocation
4. **Tracking inflow and outflow** to understand system performance

The Many Paths Project brings this evidence-based approach to Santa Fe, adapted for our community's unique needs and provider network.

## Privacy and Trust

A by-name list only works if people trust it. That's why:

### Individual Rights Come First

- **Consent is required** before information is shared
- **Individuals control** who sees their information
- **Consent can be revoked** at any time
- **Access is limited** to what each provider needs

### Data is Protected

- **HIPAA-compliant** security measures
- **Encrypted** storage and transmission
- **Role-based access** - you only see what you need to see
- **Audit trails** track who accessed what information
- **Data minimization** - we only collect what's necessary
- **Time-limited retention** - information is removed when no longer needed

### Transparency and Accountability

- **Clear governance** through fiscal sponsorship structure
- **Provider oversight** of policies and practices
- **Activity tracking** showing who updates what information
- **Regular reviews** to ensure the system is working as intended

### For Community Members

While the by-name list itself is private to providers (to protect individuals' privacy), you can support this work by:

- **Understanding the approach** and why it matters
- **Supporting provider organizations** through donations and volunteering
- **Viewing aggregate data** on our public dashboard (coming soon)
- **Advocating for coordinated care** approaches in Santa Fe

## Principles of Our By-Name List

1. **Know everyone** - Real-time data on everyone experiencing street homelessness
2. **Respect autonomy** - Individual consent and control over information
3. **Coordinate care** - Shared visibility enables collaboration
4. **Protect privacy** - Security and governance from the start
5. **Track progress** - Measure what's working to improve outcomes
6. **Stay accountable** - Transparent operations and provider oversight

## Questions?

### "How is this different from HMIS?"

HMIS (Homeless Management Information System) tracks people once they enter shelters and is primarily for federal reporting. The by-name list focuses on people currently on the streets who aren't yet in shelter systems.

### "What if someone doesn't consent?"

Providers can still track their own organization's interactions, but coordination benefits are limited without consent. We work to explain the value and build trust so people feel comfortable consenting.

### "Who sees the information?"

Only participating service providers with proper authorization. The public sees aggregate statistics only (total numbers, trends), never individual information.

### "How long is data kept?"

Information is retained as long as someone is receiving coordinated services. When they achieve stability and services end, identifying information is removed.

### "Can we customize what data we track?"

Yes! The pilot phase specifically includes collaborative design of data fields with participating providers to ensure the system meets actual needs.
