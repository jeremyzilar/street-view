## Introduction

### The Problem We're Solving

In Santa Fe, people experiencing homelessness move through various systems, but a critical gap exists that leaves many invisible to existing data collection:

1. [**UniteUS**](https://uniteus.com/) - Serves housing-insecure and food-insecure individuals, but not those already on the streets
2. **THE GAP** ‚Üê _This is where Many Paths operates_
3. **Life Link Shelter** - 3-8 month waitlist; people often lose ID, insurance, or Medicaid while waiting
4. **HMIS (The Coalition)** - Only captures people once they enter shelters, creating grossly inaccurate total counts

**Many Paths fills this critical gap** by tracking people experiencing street homelessness who have fallen out of all formal systems. This creates an accurate, real-time picture of homelessness in Santa Fe that existing systems miss.

### Our Mission: Collective Care

Many Paths operates on a **collective care** model rather than a formal coordinated entry system. Our goals are to:

- **Know everyone** experiencing street homelessness in Santa Fe in real time
- **Understand individual needs and preferences** - medical, mental health, seasonal shelter, ID, ADA accessibility, and more
- **Respect autonomy** - some people don't want shelter, and that's okay
- **Coordinate provider response** through regular case conferencing
- **Tell an accurate story** to the public about the state of homelessness in Santa Fe using real data

Without this information, we cannot:

- Understand the true scope of street homelessness in Santa Fe
- Coordinate care effectively across providers
- Respect individual preferences while offering appropriate support
- Advocate for resources based on accurate data
- Track people through the gap between systems

## Many Paths SF By-Name List

### What Is the Many Paths BNL?

The Many Paths By-Name List (BNL) is a comprehensive tracking system that ensures we know everyone experiencing street homelessness in Santa Fe, especially those who have fallen out of other systems.

### Who Gets Tracked?

**Primary focus:** People experiencing street homelessness who are NOT currently in other tracking systems.

This includes:

- People living unsheltered (streets, camps, vehicles, public spaces)
- People waiting for Life Link or other shelter (3-8 month wait times)
- People transitioning out of UniteUS support into street homelessness
- People who have lost ID, insurance, or Medicaid while unhoused
- People who are in HMIS but we continue tracking for continuity of care
- Anyone experiencing street homelessness in Santa Fe, regardless of:
  - HUD category eligibility
  - Shelter preferences
  - Service acceptance
  - Documentation status

**We track everyone, not just those who "qualify" for formal programs.**

### Information We Collect

Many Paths tracks information needed for collective care coordination:

#### Basic Information

- Name (or street name/alias if preferred)
- Approximate age
- Location(s) where person is typically found
- Contact information (if available)

#### Care Needs & Preferences

- **Medical needs** - chronic conditions, medications, healthcare access
- **Mental health support** - conditions, medications, current treatment
- **Shelter preferences** - wants shelter, doesn't want shelter, seasonal preferences
- **ID & Documentation** - has ID, lost ID, needs birth certificate, etc.
- **Insurance status** - Medicaid, uninsured, pending application
- **ADA accessibility** - mobility aids, sensory needs, accessible shelter requirements
- **Other individual needs** - case-by-case

#### System Status

- In UniteUS? (Yes/No)
- On Life Link waitlist? (Yes/No/Position if known)
- In HMIS? (Yes/No)
- Last service interaction date
- Current providers working with individual

üìã **PLACEHOLDER:** Customize data fields based on Santa Fe provider needs and case conferencing discussions.

## Data Collection & Management

### How People Get Added to the List

People are added to the Many Paths BNL through:

1. **Street outreach** - encounters during outreach work
2. **Provider referrals** - from agencies working with unhoused individuals
3. **Community reports** - respectful reports from community members
4. **Self-referral** - individuals seeking support
5. **System gaps** - people falling out of UniteUS, waiting for Life Link, etc.

### Data Entry Standards

‚ö†Ô∏è **REVIEW NEEDED:** Define specific data entry procedures for Santa Fe providers.

**Core principles:**

- Enter information within 48 hours of encounter
- Update at least monthly (more frequently if actively working with individual)
- Document all service interactions and outreach attempts
- Respect privacy - use aliases if person prefers
- Never share personally identifiable information publicly
- Coordinate with other providers before making major updates

### Privacy & Consent

**Release of Information (ROI):**

- Preferred but NOT required to be on the list
- Without ROI: Use alias/street name, limit shareable information
- With ROI: Full information can be shared among participating providers
- Always respect individual preferences for privacy

**For people who decline services:**

- Can still be tracked with minimal information (alias, general location, last contact)
- Preserves ability to connect later if person becomes ready
- Respects autonomy while maintaining awareness

### Relationship to Other Systems

#### UniteUS

- May overlap when housing-insecure becomes street homeless
- Share information with consent
- Track transition points

#### Life Link & Shelter Waitlists

- Track wait time and position if known
- Monitor for lost documentation during wait period
- Flag urgent needs that might expedite placement

#### HMIS (The Coalition)

- Continue tracking after HMIS entry for continuity
- Use to supplement coalition's statewide data (with permission)
- Track exits from HMIS back to street homelessness
- **Note:** Our data supplements, not replaces, HMIS reporting

## Collective Care Case Conferencing

### Overview

Case conferencing is the heart of the Many Paths collective care model. Participating providers meet regularly to review the By-Name List, coordinate responses, and ensure people get the support they need in a coordinated way.

### Case Conferencing Process

‚ö†Ô∏è **REVIEW NEEDED:** Establish Santa Fe-specific schedule and procedures.

**Suggested structure:**

**Frequency:** [Weekly/Bi-weekly/Monthly]

**Participants:**

- üìã **PLACEHOLDER:** List participating provider organizations
  - Street outreach teams
  - Healthcare providers
  - Mental health services
  - Shelter providers
  - Housing navigators
  - [Other providers]

**Agenda:**

1. New additions to the list
2. Active cases requiring coordination
3. Successful connections/exits
4. People losing connection (outflow review)
5. System gaps and barriers identified
6. Data review for public storytelling

### Triage & Coordination

During case conferencing, providers collaborate on:

**Individual needs assessment:**

- What does this person need right now?
- What do they want (respecting their choices)?
- Who is best positioned to help?

**Coordinated response:**

- Which provider(s) will reach out?
- What resources can we offer?
- How do we avoid duplicating efforts?
- What's the timeline for follow-up?

**Respecting autonomy:**

- Some people don't want shelter - that's okay
- Some prefer seasonal shelter (winter only, etc.)
- Some need medical care before they're ready for housing
- Some just need ID or Medicaid restored
- Meet people where they are

### Service Transactions & Contact Tracking

**Service Transaction:** Any interaction with a person on the list that provides information about their status or needs.

**When to log a service transaction:**

- Any service provided (gear, food, medical, navigation, etc.)
- Outreach contact (even if no service provided)
- Any information that updates person's status
- Confirmation person is still in the area and unhoused

**Minimum frequency:** At least one service transaction per month for active individuals

**Documentation:** Brief note in system describing:

- What happened
- What was provided/discussed
- Person's current status
- Next steps or follow-up needed

### Outflow Review Process

**Purpose:** Ensure we're not losing track of people who are still unhoused

**Process:**

1. **Monthly review** - Identify people without service transaction in 90+ days
2. **Provider check-in** - Case conferencing participants check their knowledge
   - Are they housed?
   - Did they move out of Santa Fe?
   - Are they in an institution (hospital, jail, treatment)?
   - Still unhoused but lost contact?
3. **Targeted outreach** - For people with contact info, attempt to reconnect
4. **Status update** - Update list based on information gathered
5. **Inactive marking** - Only mark inactive if confirmed housed, moved, or in institution

**Important:** Don't remove someone just because we lost contact. Mark as "contact lost" and keep trying.

---

## Exit Definitions & Tracking

### When Someone Is No Longer on the Active List

A person is moved to inactive status when:

- **Housed** - Found stable housing (temporary or permanent)
- **Moved** - Relocated outside Santa Fe area
- **Institution** - Entered hospital, treatment, jail for extended period (90+ days)
- **Deceased**

### When Someone Stays on the Active List

**Important:** People remain active even if:

- They're in UniteUS
- They're on Life Link waitlist
- They entered HMIS (we track for continuity)
- They declined services
- We temporarily lost contact (under 90 days)
- They're in short-term institution (<90 days)

### Returns

If someone returns to street homelessness after being marked inactive (lost housing, released from institution, moved back), they are reactivated immediately.

## Data for Public Storytelling

### Purpose

One of Many Paths' core goals is to tell an accurate, compelling story to the public about homelessness in Santa Fe using real data, not the incomplete picture from HMIS alone.

### What We Can Report

‚ö†Ô∏è **REVIEW NEEDED:** Establish data sharing protocols and approval process for public reporting.

**Aggregated, anonymized data only:**

- Total number of people experiencing street homelessness in Santa Fe
- How this compares to HMIS counts (showing the gap)
- Demographic breakdowns (age ranges, family vs. individual, veterans, etc.)
- Need categories and unmet needs
- Seasonal trends (winter vs. summer counts)
- Wait times for shelter/housing
- Success stories (connections made, housed, services provided)
- System gaps and barriers

**NEVER share:**

- Individual names or identifying information (without explicit permission)
- Specific locations of camps/individuals
- Personal health or mental health information
- Any data that could put individuals at risk

### Monthly/Quarterly Reporting

üìã **PLACEHOLDER:** Establish regular reporting schedule and format.

Suggested reports:

- Monthly count and trends
- Quarterly comprehensive report
- Annual state of homelessness in Santa Fe
- Special reports for city council, funders, public awareness

### Telling the Story

Use data to communicate:

1. **The gap** - "HMIS shows X people, but Many Paths found Y additional people on the streets"
2. **Individual needs** - "Z% need medical care, W% are waiting for shelter, etc."
3. **System barriers** - "Average wait time for Life Link is X months, during which people lose ID, insurance..."
4. **Collective care success** - "Through coordination, we connected X people to Y services"
5. **What's needed** - "To address homelessness in Santa Fe, we need..."
