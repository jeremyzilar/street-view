# By-Name List Operations Manual

**Last updated:** [PLACEHOLDER: Date]  
**Santa Fe, New Mexico**

---

## Introduction

A By-Name List (BNL) allows a coordinated entry system to know everyone in our community experiencing homelessness in real time.

Without this information, we cannot:

- Understand the scope of homelessness in our community
- Understand how people move in and out of our system on an ongoing basis
- Have accurate information to set goals to reduce homelessness
- Have accurate information to understand if we are making progress in ending homelessness

The key components of a quality By-Name List include ensuring that our system is touching everyone who is unhoused in our community; that we can accurately assess who is entering our unhoused system on an ongoing basis; and that we can accurately track progress through the system, including how successful we are in implementing prioritization and providing permanent housing to those who need it.

This is a living document that will change over time, please ensure you have the most recent copy.

## Amendments, Approval, + Feedback

‚ö†Ô∏è **REVIEW NEEDED:** This section describes the governance structure. Please adapt to Santa Fe's actual oversight committee structure.

The By-Name List Operations Manual is reviewed by the Santa Fe Coordinated Entry System Oversight Committee (managed through The Coalition). The primary responsibilities of the Oversight Committee are to:

- Develop the policies and procedures that ensure the coordinated entry process operates per the standards as designed by the community around the system's core elements: Access, Assessment, Prioritization, and Referral
- Review system data and metrics to identify gaps and barriers and recommend adjustments accordingly
- Monitor operations and reviewing and recommending policy additions and changes
- Oversee all policies relative to coordinated entry operations, via group decisions, guiding principles, and core elements
- All suggested changes will be presented and voted on at the Oversight Committee with a 50% +1 vote
- Procedures will be reevaluated annually in February

## BNL Definitions

A BNL is intended to include everyone in a community experiencing homelessness, meaning that the list will most likely have a larger universe of people than who is included in HMIS. Instances may exist in which counts from adjacent systems (criminal justice, education, etc.) may need to be accounted for outside of HMIS. "BNL Definitions" describes data origin, program eligibility, and commonly used terms.

### Populating the BNL

Santa Fe's BNL is populated via the Homeless Management Information System (HMIS) and potentially domestic violence provider unique ID lists (managed externally to HMIS, for safety).

### Who is included on the BNL

To be added to the Santa Fe BNL (without redacted information), an individual or family must have both a Coordinated Entry Program Enrollment and NM CoC Release of Information signed. If a household does not have a NM CoC Release completed, they can still be enrolled, but Personally Identifiable Information (PII) will be removed from shared documents. Getting a completed ROI should be a priority.

Currently, the system can serve those in HUD categories 1 and 4:

#### Category 1: Literally Homeless

Individual or family lacks a fixed, regular, and adequate nighttime residence, meaning:

- Primary nighttime residence that is a public or private space not meant for human habitation
- Is living in a publicly or privately operated shelter designated to provide temporary living arrangements (includes congregate shelters, transitional housing, and hotels/motels paid for by a nonprofit or governmental program)
- Is exiting an institution where they have resided for 90 days or less and who was literal homeless prior to entering that institution

#### Category 4: Fleeing or Attempting to Flee Domestic Violence

An individual or family who:

- Is fleeing, or attempting to flee, domestic violence
- Has no other residence; and
- Lacks the resources or support networks to obtain other permanent housing

#### Currently NOT Serving Categories 2 and 3

‚ö†Ô∏è **REVIEW NEEDED:** Verify which HUD categories Santa Fe is currently serving.

**Category 2: Imminent Risk of Homelessness** - An individual or family who will imminently lose their primary nighttime residence, provided that:

- Residence will be lost within 14 days of the date of application for homeless assistance
- No subsequent residence has been identified; and
- The individual or family lacks the resources or support networks needed to obtain other permanent housing
- Note: Includes individuals and families who are within 14 days of losing their housing, including housing they own, rent, are sharing with others, or are living in without paying rent

**Category 3: Homeless Under Other Federal Statutes** - Unaccompanied youth under 25 years of age, or families with Category 3 children and youth, who do not otherwise qualify as homeless under this definition, but who:

- Are defined as homeless under the other listed federal statutes
- Have not had a lease, ownership interest in permanent housing during the 60 days prior to the homeless assistance application
- Have experienced persistent instability as measured by two moves or more during in the preceding 60 days; and
- Can be expected to continue in such status for an extended period of time due to special needs or barriers

## BNL Common Terms + Explanations

### Household Types

| Type                              | Definition                                                                                                |
| --------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Family**                        | A household with children or dependent(s) under the age of 18 OR an individual who identifies as pregnant |
| **Youth (Unhoused Young People)** | Individuals or heads of household who are aged 18-24 years                                                |
| **Veterans**                      | Individuals who self-identify as veterans                                                                 |
| **Singles**                       | Those that do not qualify under other populations of interest (over the age of 24 who are not families)   |

### Exits (no longer active in the system)

A household is considered exited from the program when they:

- Find temporary (as defined by the Oversight Committee) or permanent housing
- Move outside of Santa Fe County (or designated service area)
- Enter an institution for 90 days or longer (\*If <90 days, will remain active)
- Pass away

### Inactive Status

**Definition:** Have not had a service transaction for 90+ days

**Process:** Reviewed on a monthly basis by Case Conferencing participants via the Outflow Process.

For a full list of Inactive Destinations, see Exit Destinations. Inactive destinations include all exits that are not permanent - Temporary or Institutional settings, Death, or Sober Living.

### Outflow Process

A list of participants reaching 90 days without a service transaction is shared with partners/access points to review every month.

**Initial Review:** For the first two weeks of the month, partnering staff review the list, adding service transactions for those they know are still unhoused/eligible.

**Final Review:** In the second two weeks of the month, a fresh pull of the Outflow occurs, alerting the system to which households need targeted outreach. The remaining households with contact information are divided amongst providers who provide one final call/email to check in - Are they housed? Out of the area? Still unhoused and would like to remain active?

All outreach attempts are to be recorded in HMIS under each household's Client Notes.

Any households that do not have a service transaction added after the final Outflow review and outreach are auto-exited to the following destinations:

- **Reason for Leaving:** Unknown/Disappeared
- **Destination:** No Exit Interview Completed

If they return, they will be re-enrolled in the program in HMIS, which triggers their reappearance on the BNL.

\*If unhoused the whole time and auto-exited, providers will create a new entry on existing client accounts with a backdate to the date of their auto-exit. For more information, see Inactivity Policy.

### Chronic Homelessness

Literally homeless individuals or households with a disabling condition who have been continuously unhoused for a year or more OR have had at least four episodes of homelessness in the past three years.

Currently, this information is populated on the BNL via a self-reported data point in the pre-screener; chronicity is not verified until a specific resource requires it.

### Returns

Re-entry into the program under existing client ID upon returning to homelessness from an inactive or housed destination.

### Service Transaction

A service transaction is an action in HMIS that populates "Date of Last Contact" on the By-Name List.

Service transactions for actively unhoused participants should occur no less than once per month.

**When to add a service transaction:**

- Any time a service has been provided
  - Examples: gear distributed to a household living unsheltered, housing navigation or care coordination provided, any interaction occurs that tells a provider an individual or family is still unhoused in our area
- üìã **PLACEHOLDER:** Shelter stays at [Emergency Shelter Name] are also tracked as service transactions
- Aside from shelter stays, all service transactions should also include a corresponding Client Note to describe service provided (can be brief)

See Making a Service Transaction step-by-step guide.

### By-Name List Categories

See Appendix A

### Test Clients

‚ö†Ô∏è **REVIEW NEEDED:** Verify if this applies to Santa Fe's HMIS platform.

Some HMIS platforms do not allow for training profile creation for new users. As such, those completing initial HMIS training may create actual profiles within the system.

- Test profiles typically have the last name "Test"
- Every 6 months, test profiles should be wholly deleted from the system at the CE Lead's request to HMIS Provider
- When test profiles are still active, they must be filtered out of the BNL:
  - Organize by last name
  - Remove test profiles from list
  - Final search for "test" to ensure all have been removed

### Other Community-Specific Definitions

üìã **PLACEHOLDER:** Add links to Santa Fe-specific program eligibility and policies & procedures documents.

## BNL Data Security

The BNL is a flexible tool that assists service providers in helping clients in their housing journeys through Santa Fe's Coordinated Entry System. The information stored in this list is critical in forming housing solutions but is also composed of personal and sensitive information that needs to be protected. In specific circumstances, data may be shared with groups or publicly, with restrictions to protect privacy and confidentiality.

### Access to BNL

The CE Lead has access to BNL and Unique Identifier lists. Portions of the BNL may be requested by CE Partners on a case-by-case basis.

The HMIS provider and platform administrators are the only providers that have the ability to build custom advanced reports in HMIS.

### Data Security

The Santa Fe BNL is stored within the current HMIS system and as a password-protected Excel Spreadsheet with designated secure storage.

Data Security is monitored and managed by the CE Lead and leaders within the system.

**Procedures in place to ensure personally identifying information (PII) is secure:**

- All extracted BNLs must be password-protected and are only shared with partnering organizations
- PII is redacted from all shared documents if a Release of Information is invalid
- All partnering and access point agencies have signed MOU, within which are specific expectations on confidentiality

### Domestic Violence Providers

‚ö†Ô∏è **REVIEW NEEDED:** Verify domestic violence provider procedures in Santa Fe.

- üìã **PLACEHOLDER:** [DV Provider Name]'s DV UI List is sent to the CE Lead as it is updated (~ 2 weeks)
- Mirrors BNL for easy copy/paste
- The DV provider utilizes coding for names; they are the only agency that knows the identities of those households

### Unsheltered without Release

For those unsheltered residents who are not in the system/HMIS, outreach teams may manage a "non-enrolled" spreadsheet. This tracking tool allows the Coordinated Entry System to understand all those experiencing homelessness, even if they have chosen not to consent to services or the assessment, or haven't yet had the opportunity. Only the most basic information will be tracked under an alias or street name to preserve anonymity.

---

## Current Data Sharing Agreements

‚ö†Ô∏è **REVIEW NEEDED:** Update with Santa Fe/New Mexico-specific agreements and policies.

### For those experiencing homelessness

- NM CoC-HMIS Release of Information
- NM Statewide Privacy Policy (if applicable)

### For the staff of partnering organizations

- Santa Fe CE Memorandum of Understanding
- HMIS Data Entry Agreement
- HMIS Privacy Rules from HUD
- Organization-specific confidentiality policies (varies)

### For volunteers

- CE Volunteer Agreement
- Organization-specific volunteer agreements (varies)

### For public information sharing

- Data must be aggregated and must not include any personally identifiable information unless an accompanying agreement or release has been signed by the participant
- If an organization outside the primary coordinating organization would like to utilize CE aggregated data for public information sharing, it must be approved by the CE Lead to ensure accuracy

## BNL Roles + Responsibilities

The coordinated entry system involves staff from many organizations working to functionally end homelessness. Cross-organizational collaboration is vital to progress on this goal. The BNL roles and responsibilities are broken down below.

### BNL Activities

‚ö†Ô∏è **REVIEW NEEDED:** Adjust timing and procedures based on Santa Fe's actual practices.

The BNL is pulled twice monthly, on the 2nd and 4th weeks of the month, by the Housing Programs Coordinator or Coordinated Entry Lead.

All staff entering data contribute to the BNL.

Data from participant interactions are expected to be entered into HMIS within 48 hours by all partnering agencies with HMIS access.

- For those without HMIS access, a paper tool may be utilized to gather information. The paper tool must then be entered by staff with HMIS access within 48 hours.

Service transactions must be added for active participants at least once monthly.

The Unique ID (DV) BNL is sent to the CE Lead any time there has been an update (~ every two weeks).

### Programs Adding Data to BNL

üìã **PLACEHOLDER:** Update with Santa Fe-specific organizations.

1. Emergency Shelters ([Organization Names])
2. Outreach Providers ([Organization Names])
3. Community Health Workers ([Organization Names])
4. Healthcare systems ([Organization Names])
5. Educational Systems (if applicable)

### End User Responsibilities

- Service transactions added for eligible participants entered at least once per month
- Information from participants entered within 48 hours
- Inflow and Outflow reviewed and actionables completed speedily and on regular basis

### CE Lead Responsibilities

- Provide direct feedback to organizations on data quality issues
- Manage BNL, creating a refreshed BNL twice monthly
- CE-specific training offered on an ongoing basis
  - Must have completed New User training with HMIS Provider first

### Training Process

‚ö†Ô∏è **REVIEW NEEDED:** Update training procedures based on Santa Fe's HMIS provider and processes.

**HMIS New User Training:**

- Required training to get HMIS login
- üìã **PLACEHOLDER:** Contact [HMIS Provider] for training schedule

**CE-Specific HMIS Training:**

- Offered ongoing, once HMIS New User Training is complete
- Facilitated by CE Lead
- Staff will create a test profile with all components of CE process documented
- Upon completion, staff will meet for a brief test profile review with CE Lead

### CE Specialists/Coordinators at CE Partnering Organizations Responsibilities

- Data quality going into the system from organization
- For organizations entering large amounts of data, the CE Lead will provide monthly insights on data directly to organizational leads. These meetings include information on data quality issues and celebrations related to assessments, enrollments, and outcomes. Additionally, these spaces allow dialogue around CE processes that aren't available or accessible because of organizational constraints.

üìã **PLACEHOLDER:** CE Lead currently meets monthly with:

- [Organization 1]
- [Organization 2]
- [Organization 3]
- [etc.]

### Quarterly Data Quality Reports

‚ö†Ô∏è **REVIEW NEEDED:** Adjust reporting schedule and metrics based on Santa Fe's needs.

Each quarter (January, April, July, October), the CE Lead will pull a report in HMIS to identify missing data within CE profiles.

- Initially, focus on Universal Data Elements and Assessment data as the most important data points to monitor
- These data quality reports will be sent out to identified leads at each access point organization, and any other partner regularly entering data in HMIS
- As capacity for data management expands, additional data quality points should be added (Current Living Situation, Chronicity, and Service Transactions as future priorities)

### Document Retention

‚ö†Ô∏è **REVIEW NEEDED:** Verify New Mexico CoC document retention requirements.

The New Mexico CoC document retention period should be followed. When paper documents cannot be immediately uploaded to HMIS, it is the organization holding the paper tools to apply standard organizational retention rates, which may be audited by HMIS administrators on annual visits.
